# doublure

**Pseudonymisation proxy between Claude Code and the Anthropic API.**

Sensitive identifiers (hosts, IPs, repositories, accounts, images, secrets) are
replaced by **plausible** surrogates before they leave the machine, and
restored on the way back. The operator always sees the real thing; the model
provider sees none of it.

The name is the mechanism. A *doublure* is the stand-in who takes the hits in
the actor's place — and the lining sewn inside a coat. Surrogates are plausible
on purpose (decision D1): never `[HOST_1]`, always something the model can
still reason with.

operation, known limits and the adversarial record.

## Start

```bash
devbox install        # pinned toolchain: uv, go, node, task, curl, jq
task                  # lists everything that can be run

task detector         # infrastructure detection :9000 — leave it running
task detector:pii     # personal data :9100 — leave it running too
task proxy            # proxy :8090 — refuses to serve without BOTH
task session          # a Claude Code session through the proxy

task forward -- claude   # any agent, behind the forward proxy
```

The detector needs the NVIDIA driver and a CUDA build of torch, so it lives
outside devbox in its own virtualenv; `services/anonshield/wrapper/install-cuda.sh`
sets it up the first time, and after any `uv sync` inside `upstream/`.

The vault and the master secret live in the user state directory — outside the
repo, never read by the agent. The vault is **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM,
key derived from the master secret): the file alone reveals nothing. **Back up
both: the secret and the database are the two halves; losing either makes
de-anonymisation impossible.**

## Verify

```bash
task test             # unit suites (Python and Go)
task test:egress      # egress harness
task proofs           # every end-to-end proof (needs the detector)

task bench:corpus     # metrics on the annotated corpus
task bench:latency    # detection latency (<150 ms)
task bench:parser     # inputs the bash grammar still refuses
```

The proofs start real processes and, for two of them, a real Claude Code
session. `task proofs` is the complete set; a faster loop while working is the
two unit suites plus `policy`, `control` and `forward` — but `control` is the
only one that crosses into Go, and leaving it out once left the control
interface disconnected for two rounds.

Three layers, and each finds what the one below does not:

- the **unit suites** find what you thought to check;
- the **end-to-end proofs** found three defects the suites never saw — a broken
  schema, a rejected `cache_control`, a session burning its turns on a file
  whose name had been masked;
- **real sessions** found four more in a single afternoon, two of which
  twenty-four rounds of adversarial review had missed. After changing a
  surrogate generator, run one, and read the model's reasoning as well as its
  answer: told that the layer exists, it reports what does not hold in its own
  surrogates.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `ANONPROXY_SCOPE` | `project:<folder>` | Determinism scope (`session:`/`tenant:`/`global`) |
| `ANONPROXY_DETECT_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` | Detection service |
| `ANONPROXY_MODE` | `auto` | `auto` \| `consciencieux` \| `ferme` — a mode is a set of settings |
| `ANONPROXY_REGEX_THRESHOLD` | `8000` | Above this, regex detection (large volumes) |
| `ANON_DEVICE` | `auto` | `cuda` \| `cpu` — `cuda` fails if unavailable |
| `ANONPROXY_PII_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:9100` | Personal-data detector — the only source of `PERSON` |
| `ANONPROXY_PII` | *(unset)* | `off` disables it explicitly; an outage is a 503, never a silent gap |
| `ANON_ALLOWLIST_FILE` | `config/allowlist.txt` | Read by both sides of the D7 boundary |
| `ANON_CUSTOM_PATTERNS_FILE` | `config/custom_patterns.json` | Read by both sides too |
| `ANON_INVENTORY_FILE` | `config/inventory.txt` | "What is ours" — keep the real one out of the tree |

State lives in `~/.doublure/<slug of the project path>` — one directory per
project, so two projects never share a vault. The rule is duplicated in bash,
in Python and in Go because the hook has to know it without importing
anything; the three had drifted apart, and only the launcher setting
`ANONPROXY_STATE_DIR` explicitly hid it.

The control service has no default for those paths at all and refuses to start
without them, so that a second source of truth cannot drift from the
launcher's.

!!! danger "Migrating an existing state directory"

    Renaming it is a `mv`, and the vault is half of what makes surrogates
    restorable. Stop the chain first, move it, and keep the old guard patterns
    — they still refuse the old location, which costs nothing and covers the
    interval.

Detection reads `config/allowlist.txt` (§6 of the plan) and
`config/custom_patterns.json` (environment conventions, to be written with jo).
Those files sit on neutral ground: BOTH the detection service and the surrogate
engine read them, so "this token is public" is maintained in one place.

**What ships here is an example, on synthetic material.** A real deployment
fills `config/inventory.txt` with the labels that are ITS OWN — company name,
internal zones, team prefixes — which is the one list you do not want to
publish by committing it. Point `ANON_INVENTORY_FILE` (and
`ANON_ALLOWLIST_FILE`) at files outside the working tree and keep yours there.
A path you ask for and that does not exist is an error, never an empty
inventory: reading it as empty would re-open, in silence, the names it was
meant to close.

## Confidentiality policy

Closed by default: everything detected is substituted, and every value no rule
covers is recorded as a question — without blocking. The operator answers once,
at one of three granularities (this value, this type, this class) and one of
four scopes (global, project, session, message), each the default for the next.

```bash
task policy -- questions                          # anonymised without a rule
task policy -- arbitrer                           # answer, one at a time
task policy -- valeur projet PERSON "Ada" reveler # decide on a value you name
task control                                      # API, for the IDE extension
```

`message` is the narrowest scope and the least committing: nothing is recorded,
so there is no rule to revoke — the answer dies with the message it was given
for.

Revealing is the only decision that lets a value out, so it is never a default,
it is traced, and revoking it does not recall what has already gone. A SECRET
is never revealable (D4).

## Licence

**MIT** ([LICENSE](LICENSE)), except `services/anonshield/**` which is
**GPL-3.0** (upstream plus our wrapper). It communicates with the rest **over
HTTP only**: `src/anonproxy/` never imports from that directory (decision D7),
which is what makes the two licences coexist here.

That is not left to prose — [tests/test_gpl_boundary.py](tests/test_gpl_boundary.py)
fails on any import that crosses, in either direction. Details:
[LICENSES.md](LICENSES.md).

## Known limits

**Bash output is pseudonymised** — it returns to the model through the API,
which is channel 1. What is not reversible is the **execution**: `kubectl` has
to reach the real cluster, and there is no fictional cluster to talk to. So on
that path the hook stops data going OUT (a `curl` to a third party, a vault
read, an environment dump) instead of substituting. Hiding your infrastructure
from the model is channel 1's job, and it does it.

**Remote MCP no longer belongs in that sentence.** `task forward -- <agent>`
runs any agent behind a forward proxy that terminates TLS and pseudonymises
JSON-RPC bodies both ways. It is not the default path — `task session` still
only covers the model API — the destination list is written by the operator,
and it has **not yet been exercised by a real session**.

Four destinations out of five ignore `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; none of them ignore
an explicit proxy, which is what makes the above possible.

**On a workstation, D9 is not met**: the egress harness detects, it does not
prevent. The only shape where the proxy really is the sole path is a
containerised deployment (`internal` network, proxy straddling both) or one
framed by a sandbox — `docs/d9-network-isolation.md`. Plainly: the proxy
reduces the surface, it does not close it.

`docs/re-identification-analysis.md` gives the full inventory of residual risks
and accepted leaks.
