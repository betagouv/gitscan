# RepoFalcon 🦅

**RepoFalcon** turns a repository into deterministic artifacts and a queryable code knowledge graph that developers, CI pipelines, and coding agents can use immediately.

It is especially useful when you want to:

- give **Claude Code** or another coding agent a structural view of the repository instead of making it work file by file
- generate **pull request context** in CI before an automated review step
- publish **stable artifacts** that other tools can consume without needing a database or a long-running service

---

## Why teams use RepoFalcon

Modern repositories are harder to review than they are to compile. A pull request may change only a few files while affecting callers, packages, or architectural boundaries elsewhere.

RepoFalcon maps repository structure into a graph so you can answer practical questions faster:

- What files and symbols are impacted by this PR?
- Which packages depend on this module?
- What context should I provide to Claude Code before asking for a refactor?
- What deterministic artifacts should CI publish for downstream automation?

RepoFalcon currently supports:

- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Go

---

## Quickstart

**Homebrew** (macOS / Linux):

```bash
brew install SocialGouv/repo-falcon/falcon
```

Or install the latest binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://socialgouv.github.io/repo-falcon/install.sh | sh
```

Or install to a custom directory (no sudo):

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=. curl -fsSL https://socialgouv.github.io/repo-falcon/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/SocialGouv/repo-falcon/releases/latest/download/falcon-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile falcon.exe
```

You can also download binaries manually from the [latest release page](https://github.com/SocialGouv/repo-falcon/releases/latest).

### Uninstall

Remove the binary and any generated project artifacts:

```bash
# Remove the binary (default location; adjust if you used a custom INSTALL_DIR)
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/falcon

# Remove generated artifacts from your projects
rm -rf .falcon/

# Remove fleet configuration (if you used fleet features)
rm -rf ~/.falcon/
```

**The one command to know:**

```bash
falcon sync
```

Run it once to set up, run it again anytime to refresh. It is fully idempotent.

This command:

1. indexes the repository
2. builds a deterministic snapshot
3. generates [`.falcon/CONTEXT.md`](.falcon/CONTEXT.md)
4. configures coding-agent integrations (interactive on first run, or pass `--agents claude,cursor,windsurf,copilot,roo,cline`)

If you want to run the steps manually:

```bash
falcon index --repo . --out .falcon/artifacts
falcon snapshot --in .falcon/artifacts --out .falcon/artifacts
falcon pr-pack --repo . --snapshot .falcon/artifacts --base <base-sha-or-ref> --head <head-sha-or-ref> --out .falcon/artifacts
```

Typical generated outputs:

```text
.falcon/
  artifacts/
    metadata.json
    files.parquet
    symbols.parquet
    packages.parquet
    edges.parquet
    findings.parquet
    nodes.parquet
    pr_context_pack.json
    review_report.md
  CONTEXT.md
```

## Use case: Claude Code and coding agents

One of the clearest use cases for RepoFalcon is preparing a repository for **Claude Code** or another coding agent.

Without RepoFalcon, an agent usually has to discover architecture by reading files, grepping imports, and guessing dependency direction. With RepoFalcon, the repository already has a graph-backed summary and MCP tools available.

### Typical workflow

```bash
falcon sync --agents claude
```

That setup gives you two useful layers:

1. **Static context** via [`.falcon/CONTEXT.md`](.falcon/CONTEXT.md)
2. **Live graph queries** via [`falcon mcp serve`](internal/cli/mcp.go)

RepoFalcon can also update Claude Code files such as [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and MCP configuration so the agent knows when to query repository structure instead of relying only on raw file search.

### Concrete example

Imagine you ask Claude Code to refactor a package boundary or rename a function used across multiple modules.

With RepoFalcon in place, Claude Code can:

- inspect file dependencies before editing
- understand package boundaries before introducing a new import
- search symbol relationships structurally instead of relying only on grep
- refresh graph artifacts after a major refactor

This makes refactors safer and reduces wasted context-window usage.

For the full integration guide, agent-specific setup, and MCP details, see [`docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md).

## Use case: pull request analysis in CI

RepoFalcon is designed to run well in CI because its outputs are deterministic and easy to publish as artifacts.

A common workflow is:

1. index the repository
2. snapshot the graph into normalized artifacts
3. generate a PR context pack
4. pass those artifacts to another review or automation step

### Why this matters

This is useful when you want to run an AI reviewer, publish a review summary, or keep machine-readable artifacts for later analysis.

Instead of asking downstream tooling to rediscover the repository from scratch, CI can hand over:

- `pr_context_pack.json` for structured PR context
- `review_report.md` for human-readable review material
- Parquet graph artifacts for deeper analysis

### Manual CI commands

```bash
falcon index --repo . --out artifacts
falcon snapshot --in artifacts --out artifacts
falcon pr-pack --repo . --snapshot artifacts --base "$BASE_SHA" --head "$HEAD_SHA" --out artifacts
```

The key step for reproducibility is running [`snapshot`](internal/cli/snapshot.go) after indexing. More details are available in [`docs/CI.md`](docs/CI.md).

---

## GitHub Action usage

RepoFalcon ships as a reusable composite action via [`action.yml`](action.yml).

Example workflows are included in this repository:

- [`.github/workflows/repofalcon_pr_context.yml`](.github/workflows/repofalcon_pr_context.yml)
- [`.github/workflows/repofalcon_then_claude_review.yml`](.github/workflows/repofalcon_then_claude_review.yml)

### Example: generate PR context artifacts

```yaml
name: RepoFalcon PR context

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  repofalcon:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate RepoFalcon artifacts
        id: falcon
        uses: <owner>/repo-falcon@<ref>
        with:
          mode: pr
          repo: .
          out: artifacts
          base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          head: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      - name: Upload RepoFalcon artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: repofalcon-artifacts
          path: ${{ steps.falcon.outputs.artifacts-dir }}
          if-no-files-found: error
```

### Example: run RepoFalcon before Claude review

The typical pattern is:

1. generate RepoFalcon artifacts in one job
2. upload or pass them to a downstream AI review job
3. let the reviewer consume structured outputs instead of rediscovering the repo

See [`.github/workflows/repofalcon_then_claude_review.yml`](.github/workflows/repofalcon_then_claude_review.yml) for a concrete example of this pipeline shape.

## What RepoFalcon produces

RepoFalcon generates artifacts that can be consumed by humans, scripts, CI systems, or coding agents.

### Core graph artifacts

- `files.parquet`
- `symbols.parquet`
- `packages.parquet`
- `edges.parquet`
- `nodes.parquet`
- `metadata.json`

### Review-oriented artifacts

- `pr_context_pack.json` — structured machine-readable context for a PR
- `review_report.md` — a human-readable review summary
- [`.falcon/CONTEXT.md`](.falcon/CONTEXT.md) — a compact repository overview for coding agents

---

## How it works

RepoFalcon combines several analysis steps to build a repository graph:

1. parse source files to extract structure
2. identify symbols and relationships
3. detect imports and dependencies
4. optionally incorporate findings
5. materialize a repository snapshot
6. generate PR-oriented or agent-oriented outputs from that graph

This structure enables:

- pull-request impact analysis
- architecture exploration
- dependency mapping
- security finding correlation
- AI-assisted code review

---

## Determinism

RepoFalcon is designed to be CI-friendly and reproducible:

- repository-relative paths are canonicalized
- Parquet row ordering is stable after snapshotting
- JSON outputs are written with stable field ordering and without timestamps

Integration tests run the CLI twice on the same fixture repositories and compare logical Parquet contents plus byte-level outputs for generated review artifacts.

---

## Use case: multi-repository search (fleet)

When you manage multiple repositories, RepoFalcon can index them all and provide cross-repo search and analysis.

### Setup

Create a fleet manifest listing your repos:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.falcon
cat > ~/.falcon/fleet.json << 'EOF'
{
  "version": "1",
  "repos": [
    {"path": "/home/user/apps/web-app", "name": "web-app"},
    {"path": "/home/user/apps/api-server"},
    {"path": "/home/user/apps/mobile-app"}
  ]
}
EOF
```

Index all repos at once:

```bash
falcon fleet sync
```

### Cross-repo MCP server

Start an MCP server that gives coding agents cross-repo awareness:

```bash
falcon fleet mcp serve
```

This exposes fleet-specific tools: `fleet_overview`, `fleet_search`, `fleet_find_repos_by_dependency`, `fleet_symbol_lookup`, `fleet_common_dependencies`, `fleet_repo_architecture`, and `fleet_file_context`.

### Ad-hoc SQL queries via DuckDB

Run SQL directly against all indexed repos (requires the `duckdb` CLI):

```bash
# Find which apps implemented magic link auth with Next.js
falcon fleet query "
  SELECT DISTINCT p._repo
  FROM all_packages p
  JOIN all_packages m ON p._repo = m._repo
  WHERE p.name = 'next' AND m.name = 'magic-sdk'
"

# Find the loginWithMagicLink call sites
falcon fleet query "SELECT _repo, qualified_name, kind FROM all_symbols WHERE qualified_name ILIKE '%loginWithMagicLink%'"

# Compare tech stacks across repos
falcon fleet query "SELECT _repo, name FROM all_packages WHERE is_internal = false ORDER BY _repo, name"
```

The `--repos` flag can override the manifest for one-off searches:

```bash
falcon fleet sync --repos ~/apps/web,~/apps/api
falcon fleet query --repos ~/apps/web,~/apps/api "SELECT _repo, name FROM all_packages WHERE name = 'magic-sdk'"
```
