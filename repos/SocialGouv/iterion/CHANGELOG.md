## [3.202.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.201.0...v3.202.0) (2026-09-25)

### Features

* **cloud:** a pinned provider funds its own slot at the org and platform tiers ([#1818](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1818)) ([b0ccd66](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b0ccd660a523fe5216ee6661dd6e5e6b1378dd8a)), references [#659](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/659) [#736](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/736) [#1859](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1859)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The shared tiers fill one credential per WIRE FAMILY, so a tenant whose org or platform holds both an Anthropic and a Moonshot key was served anthropic alone — and a node pinned `provider: moonshot` was then refused, correctly, with its funding one row away. Measured on the platform tier before this:

### Features

* **server,cli,mcp,studio:** a run is addressed by its id, across the teams you may see ([8f509ad](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8f509adff9d287e36838e691744ef51def27bf3d)), closes [#1847](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1847) [#1848](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1848) [#1407](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1407) [#1849](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1849), references [#1847](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1847) [#1848](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1848)

## [3.200.3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.200.2...v3.200.3) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **auth:** refuse admin password reset for disabled accounts ([#1863](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1863)) ([4c245ce](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4c245ced1ff551a461445057fc1cc8e6c41e62d3)), closes [#1561](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1561), references [#1862](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1862)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Return an actionable 422 before generating a credential or changing the account. Preserve active/pending recovery and explicit re-enable semantics. Cover the HTTP journey and document the refusal; concurrent stale writes remain separately tracked in #1862.

    </details>
* **claude-code:** align task credential precedence across CLI passes ([#1859](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1859)) ([d484906](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d484906e34036d14a2dd08d4a60bfa0046a93dbe)), closes [#1836](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1836)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Compose ambient forwarding, task env additions and selected credential routes once for host/sandbox main and format spawns. Bind direct credentials to their route, protect resolver markers, and preserve inherited gateway fingerprints.

    </details>

## [3.200.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.200.1...v3.200.2) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **mcp:** reserve internal server names across catalog and CLI adapters ([#1861](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1861)) ([d94706b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d94706b5ccdb24a49f33f48ce61ec55f2872f2fe)), closes [#1742](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1742)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Reject user/project/plugin MCP names that normalize into the permission-exempt infrastructure namespace. Keep internal registrations and custom servers separate, with a shared identity check and actionable rename diagnostics.

    </details>

## [3.200.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.200.0...v3.200.1) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **credpool:** release only the lease owned by a launch grant ([#1856](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1856)) ([b13f7ef](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b13f7ef0f55f6c7205e57351a601f33794e1f88d)), closes [#1845](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1845)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Bind cleanup to the lease inserted by Acquire so a losing launch or resume cannot close a concurrent acquisition for the same run. Keep the existing close CAS and consumed-run accounting semantics.

## [3.199.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.199.1...v3.199.2) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **server,credpool,runview:** a launch refuses a run id another run already uses, in any team ([e827696](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e82769697df585dee6507daef254aa51d0c56148)), closes [#1845](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1845) [#1833](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1833), references [#1833](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1833)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    POST /api/runs accepted a caller-supplied run_id and used it as-is. A launch naming an existing run's id — any team's — reached the credential pool, whose Acquire first supersedes every open lease of that run id through a team-blind query: the other team's leases were closed before the duplicate-id save failed, the donor's slot was freed and the charge erased while the run still used the credential. The launch's answer also differed on whether the id existed. (#1833)

    </details>
* **server:** the artifact version route gates on the run's team; ?store= is refused on a cloud instance ([308def3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/308def3612583852ff746b206cc3296c9c7c8652)), closes [#1832](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1832)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    GET /api/runs/{id}/artifacts/{node}/{version} read the artifact body with no team gate. In cloud mode the body comes from the blob store (artifacts/<run>/<node>/<version>.json), which knows no team, so the route served another team's artifact to any authenticated caller who knew the run id. The handler now loads the run under the caller's context first, as its siblings do.

    </details>

## [3.199.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.199.0...v3.199.1) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **studio:** reuse tabs within the active project ([#1830](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1830)) ([1a0f846](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1a0f8467c115ecee5412e799eca4ae3f84c9d98e)), references [#1811](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1811)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Opening the same file or draft in another project now selects a tab that the current editor can display. Reuse follows the existing visibility scope, including the unscoped cloud mode.

    </details>
* **studio:** select a visible neighbour when closing tabs ([#1840](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1840)) ([b357d97](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b357d97e7ccb82eab3707d2fc6529c0d98d09358)), closes [#1829](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1829)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Keep the replacement active editor or run tab in the current project. Compute both the candidate list and the closed-tab index in that scope; retain global cloud selection when project scoping is disabled.

    </details>

## [3.199.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.198.1...v3.199.0) (2026-09-25)

### Features

* **models:** default bots to Opus 5.5 and GPT-6 ([#1835](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1835)) ([62309a8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/62309a8ca2ac71a2f70ff0584c6f6b67253d8605)), references [#1831](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1831) [#1837](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1837)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Migrate catalog and implicit defaults, preserve explicit overrides, and pin compatible CLI versions. Adapt structured/grounded generation to mandatory adaptive thinking and consume the published GPT-6 SDK support.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **studio:** expose typed schedule failures and recovery advice ([#1825](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1825)) ([6b9d278](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6b9d2780f00d8d4e420d1d5ddf491c50025e57c5)), references [#1565](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1565)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Show the last run outcome and separate launch refusals in schedule rows. Use the persisted failure code for run hints before parsing legacy text. Keep the configured cadence and the existing manual pause control.

    </details>

## [3.198.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.198.0...v3.198.1) (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **dsl:** preserve literals and quoted reference lists when writing ([#1822](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1822)) ([a276854](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a276854cfeb238e4e375224dc70ccd9c2e873fe5)), references [#1810](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1810) [#1736](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1736) [#1624](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1624) [#1809](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1809)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Keep decimal floats parseable and typed, quote non-bare reference list values through the active string profile, and refuse JSON integers that the author YAML reader cannot represent as int64.

## [3.198.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.197.3...v3.198.0) (2026-09-25)

### Features

* **moonshot:** Kimi as a first-class provider on the Anthropic wire ([#1744](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1744)) ([#1753](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1753)) ([76aeef2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/76aeef26ef96d5de271b5acc60ecc59480245aa1))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Moonshot was reachable only through `backend: "kimi"` — the CLI-agent route (ADR-065), which resolves its own credentials from the host env and sits outside the credential store entirely: no BYOK record, no funding walk, no usage windows, no rotation. A campaign whose only Anthropic-wire providers are anthropic and z.ai freezes the day both are walled at once, and that is not hypothetical: it cost hours, with one key on a dated weekly window, one forfait revoked and one team slot…

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime,bots:** ${BUNDLE_SKILLS_DIR} is absolute or the run is refused, and a child never inherits its parent's copy ([#1806](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1806)) ([96a6b16](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/96a6b16823ca9dc869e132209e1e9544c6055dc3)), references [#1797](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1797) [#1797](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1797)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A reader joins a skill NAME onto the directory, so an empty or relative value resolved against the node's own working directory — the checkout — and the data block came back from whatever the repository put at that path. The previous spelling carried a literal `/`, which could not collapse that way.

## [3.197.3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.197.2...v3.197.3) (2026-09-24)

### Bug Fixes

* **studio:** every async answer settles only what it was asked about ([#1770](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1770)) ([#1793](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1793)) ([1f29d1c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1f29d1c53d2f68426e0977e9647a7ad60e69eb4c)), closes [#1650](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1650) [#1662](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1662), references [#1733](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1733) [#1791](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1791) [#1790](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1790) [#1788](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1788) [#1789](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1789)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Every answer the editor waits for — an Open, an example, an import, a save, a validation, a reload, a Source-view Apply, the assistant's apply and reload, a draft following its conversation — now carries the identity it was asked about, and settles only that. A superseded answer (a newer request speaks for the author) is dropped quietly; an answer refused because the author worked meanwhile says so.

## [3.197.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.197.1...v3.197.2) (2026-09-24)

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime,bots:** read `iterion:` skill data blocks from an engine-owned copy ([#1797](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1797)) ([84b62b2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/84b62b2761c168f16b701b3f8dbecdeb9b208889))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A tool node that parses a machine-readable `iterion:` block out of a skill read it from `<workspace>/.claude/skills/`. That directory applies the workspace-wins collision policy, and the workspace is a checkout of the repository under audit: the checkout could both replace a shipped skill and supply a name the bundle never ships, and either was read as the bundle's. Five bots parse such blocks (`scanners`, `heuristics`, `lockfiles`, `reattack`, `pkgmgr`) across eleven read sites, and one of…

    The author document — a `.bot.yaml`, the YAML twin of a `.bot` read by pkg/dsl/author — is a draft of a workflow, never one (lot 5 of #1010, the arbitrated surface: a way of writing the .bot, not a second truth). Before any surface reads one, every surface that would launch, upload, schedule, store or resolve one refuses it by name, with one typed sentinel (`bundle.ErrAuthorDocument`, errors.Is) and the remedy in the message (write the .bot it stands for — the fmt command that writes it names…

* **auto-maintenance:** the recipe, and a preflight that reddens on a broken agreement ([#1752](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1752)) ([906e477](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/906e477b3f804582d89da1d68af4f3f3b59e622f)), references [#1589](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1589) [#1595](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1595) [#1597](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1597) [#1596](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1596) [#1585](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1585) [#1591](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1591) [#1589](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1589) [#1595](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1595)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An unattended dependency loop rests on settings in three systems — the repository ruleset, the iterion integration, the App installations — and nothing type-checks the agreement between them. That is how the headline friction of this epic was born: a gate context renamed on one of two sites, with no repository able to see the disagreement.

    The modernize bot declared no platform credential, so a contract could not declare an exit gate that judges a DEPLOYED application — only a locally started one. Such a gate refuses for want of an identity it has no way to be given, whatever the lot did, and that refusal says nothing about the work.

### Bug Fixes

* **model:** a failing tool node leaves its output on the event, not only in the log ([#1692](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1692)) ([8b67cd3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8b67cd355ced202d2e6cc6115cc5ce8360a7fad9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A tool node's completion event carried its error and nothing else. On a failure that meant one string — `exit status 1` — while the command's own stdout and stderr went to the run log, a different sink, under a hook an operator auditing the failure does not read.

### Bug Fixes

* **runview:** a refused run-level fallback reaches the run's timeline ([#1583](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1583)) ([7d88d51](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7d88d5161bdc219f9c3545c344fee56d7dea196d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The launch-time fallback chain is screened before it is materialised onto a node, and the screen is right to refuse: an empty tools: list crossing to a CLI backend would silently hand that node the full unrestricted toolset, a codex route cannot run inside an active sandbox, a stage naming a backend with no model resolves to nothing. Each refusal already carries a precise, actionable sentence.

* **server,docs:** revoking a team credential takes the same right as creating one ([#1689](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1689)) ([01119d2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/01119d24187f4b501b04f8ed85bcfcfbb142fe4c)), references [#1687](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1687)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Creating a team BYOK key or generic secret gates on `canManageTeam`, which carries the org arm; revoking one gated on `canMutateScopedRecord`, which did not. An org admin could install a credential in any team of their org and never take it back — strictly worse than not being able to install it, since the key funds runs and its plaintext is write-only from that point on.

* **delegate:** a facade's dated wall is a window, not a throttle ([#1602](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1602)) ([8fbe427](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8fbe427fc72aa91f30e18db3bd860e9b2265b71c)), references [#1583](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1583)

    The ZAI-shaped facade words its multi-day wall differently from its 5h one: "Usage limit reached for 5 hour. Your limit will reset at …" against "[1310][Weekly/Monthly Limit Exhausted. Your limit will reset at …]". Only the first was in usageWindowSignals, so the second fell through to RateLimitKindTransient — a dated wall filed as a retryable throttle.

* **gate:** a verdict certifies the revision it read, and the auto-merge arming is pinned to it ([#1657](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1657)) ([92ba384](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/92ba384a82862d3f22f5aa76b5a006faffac6cbc)), references [#1586](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1586) [#1586](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1586) [#1585](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1585) [#1587](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1587) [#1587](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1587) [#1587](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1587) [#1633](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1633)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The publish endpoint resolved the pull request's head at the moment it wrote the commit status, and the payload carried no revision at all (`pkg/server/forge_publish.go:720-762`). So a bot could audit A, a push land B, and A's verdict certify B. With a required check, `required_approving_review_count: 0` and auto-merge armed — the exact shape `SocialGouv/buildkit-operator` carries — that is a path for an unaudited commit to reach the default branch.

    The Source view showed a bot in several files as its merged program, read-only, and told the author to "open each file from the files drawer" — a control that renders only for a cloud `botsource://` path, so every local author was sent to something that was not on their screen. It is now a picker over `unit.files`: one file's text at a time, rendered from the open document by provenance, with the merged program as a read-only entry; an edit is re-parsed with that one file replaced, and the save…

    "this node has no tools" was unsayable. Four independent erasures: the parser returned nil for `[]`, the AST's JSON seam dropped it through `omitempty`, `iterion fmt` wrote the line only for a non-empty list, and the studio replaced an emptied tag list with `undefined`. `bots/evolve`'s gpt reviewer is what that cost: a formatting pass deleted its `tools: []` and left ten comment lines describing a rule nothing carried.

* **dsl:** a var declares its own constraint, so an operator typo is refused at launch ([#1628](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1628)) ([5f49b45](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5f49b4560e30aadd0e75fd5b2eaa66dfe0cb0f65)), closes [#1609](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1609), references [#1608](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1608) [#1601](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1601) [#1601](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1601) [#1350](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1350)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `vars:` declaration could carry a type and an `[enum: "a","b"]` set, but nothing narrower: a value that is a legal string and a nonsense one — the ticket's ` codeX --some-flag` — reached the run untouched and degraded inside whatever node consumed it, at the same coverage value a MISSING binary produces. Measured before the change: `iterion run --var "agent= codeX --some-flag"` finished green.

### Bug Fixes

* **dsl:** a preset value is checked against its var's enum and matching constraints at compile time ([#1660](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1660)) ([2beec3b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2beec3b162a3f6bc436569c9354ae717a7e6309d)), references [#1611](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1611) [#1350](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1350)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `presets:` entry could set a var to a value its `[enum: ...]` or its `[matching: "<re>"]` constraint refuses, and nothing looked: `iterion validate` said `result: OK` and only `iterion run --preset <name>` died at the launch gate. A bot could ship a preset no launch can accept.

* **repomap:** the docs map links resolve from docs/references on the site, not from the repository root ([#1625](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1625)) ([774fc6b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/774fc6b17f0577953c888780b61751e42d0b1015)), references [#1505](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1505) [#1508](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1508) [#1508](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1508)

    The Page column of docs/references/map-docs.md wrote every target as `../../docs/<page>.md`. github.com resolves that against the map's own directory and serves the page; the documentation site's root IS docs/, so the same target climbs out of the site and names nothing there. 318 dead links on one page: the `docs` job has failed on every push to main since 09bd1d0b1 (#1505) and the site has not published for three days.

* **dsl:** a comment keeps the place it was written at, through a save and through fmt ([#1616](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1616)) ([15de46b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/15de46be580c2141547223791143e5bb300f0412)), references [#1282](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1282)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The parser kept only the file-head `##` comments. A comment written inside a declaration, between two, or at the end of a line never reached the AST, so a studio save and `iterion fmt` dropped it — and `unparse.Verify` could not see the loss, because the compiled program does not carry comments and the mirror comparison left them out. `iterion fmt` refused 59 of the 81 shipped `.bot` files for that reason alone.

    `effectiveNodeBackend` returned `""` — "no opinion" — for any backend string containing `${`, and `""` short-circuits every COMPARISON screen: the `tools:` inversion, the session-continuity refusal, the C177 effort drift, the primary-route permission-gate check, and the same set inside `ApplyRunFallback`, the launch-time `--fallback` admission. A node whose backend is an env dial therefore ran unscreened, and an author could add a route crossing the claw⇄CLI boundary to one and have it compile…

### Features

* **runtime:** a list value renders by its declaration, and a var's text has one reading ([#1601](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1601)) ([b38cba0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b38cba0db45b2e1f20ca02fb01aa793bf7d1ecfb)), references [#1320](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1320) [#1285](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1285) [#1320](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1320) [#1320](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1320) [#1285](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1285)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `json` value and a `string[]` value reach a tool body as the same Go value — []any — so the renderer alone could never tell a document from an argv list. It guessed by shape: a scalar list space-joined, which is right for `string[]` and runs the second element as a command for `json`, and an EMPTY list rendered as nothing at all, so `cmd {{vars.x}} --flag` lost its argument and `--flag` shifted one place left, in silence, with the node reporting SUCCESS (#1320).

### Features

* **dsl:** allow/ask/deny are declarable per agent and judge node, and a node list REPLACES the workflow's ([#1581](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1581)) ([8a7bb2b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8a7bb2b4922c971fc50deaa28200a857597fb7cb)), references [#1222](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1222)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `allow:` / `ask:` / `deny:` existed on the `workflow` block only; just the scalar `permission:` mode descended to a node. So a workflow whose nodes need different bounds had no way to say so, and the author's only lever was `permission: off` on the node that needed more — which removes every rule, not the one in the way.

Both staging gestures read that as failure: the wip bank left the run's work unbanked in a preserved worktree, the operator's commit-and-finalize failed. Measured on the #1464 dogfood.

    A syntax floor (`parser.ProfileSince[2]`, `ImportSince`, `ContractSince`, `bundle.ToolAliasesSince`) is pinned by hand to the next minor above the release main carries — a guess written before the number is known, realigned by hand when a release overtakes it.

* **dispatcher/native:** the index watcher's default constructor goes through fswatch, and the class is inventoried ([#1568](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1568)) ([6a682fe](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6a682fe8063ff137cdd01dd630008b3b095c0b78)), references [#1200](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1200) [#1051](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1051) [#1198](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1198)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The native board store opens one inotify instance per store, unconditionally, and logs a refused one with %v and nothing else. Its constructor was the raw fsnotify.NewWatcher, so that refusal reached the log as "too many open files" and nothing more — which on an ARC runner does not say whether the process ran out of descriptors or the real UID ran out of inotify instances, a budget shared with every other container under that UID. That distinction is what #1198's diagnosis rests on.

* **live:** the last-green ledger answers "do the live e2e still pass?" for free, and the DRAFT stabilisation plan ([#1511](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1511)) ([b59914d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b59914db4f6bac3a57445b252e63cdd4c913670b)), references [#1424](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1424) [#1422](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1422) [#1424](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1424) [#1422](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1422)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The plan #1424 asks for, as a DRAFT: per core surface, what is already free (measured from the coverage matrix's 387 rows), what must become free, what must stay paid and why, and the budget one stabilisation pass costs. Candidate order DSL → runtime → backends → bots, ranked by what breaks the most when it moves; no engine change, no new tests for tests' sake.

* **review-pr:** the reviewer runs on z.ai glm-5.3 while the claude forfait is capped ([#1519](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1519)) ([8b6b60f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8b6b60f1454364405478bc06aefc8fbebd6593b9)), references [pre-#1390](https://github.com/pre-/issues/1390)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The merge gate's reviewer fleet is parked: the deployment's Anthropic forfait is under a multi-day cap, and every PR in this repo crosses this bot. All four reviewer nodes (reviewer_claude, reviewer_gpt and both glance twins) are pinned to provider "zai" + model "glm-5.3".

    The gates that judge a run's worktree must set aside what the run's own setup and tooling wrote: the `.claude/` mirror the engine lays at run start (#1364) and the devbox.lock every devbox invocation rewrites (#1459). Until now that exclusion lived as literals in 26 bot files and 27 identical python `is_scaffold` copies, and the engine's own finalizer carried a third spelling (`scaffoldPrefix`).

    The class: every launch-time override iterion run accepts must either be persisted on the run and replayed on resume, or recomputed on purpose (documented). Two facets of one class were paying the ticket tax: --sandbox at launch was silently ignored by resume (docker on a host that saw one), and --merge-into / --branch-name / auto-merge choices were dropped between the CLI launch and the studio's resume. A third, smaller one on the way: answers of a resume that failed AFTER recording them (a…

### Bug Fixes

* **dsl:** a with: mapping refuses what the runtime cannot resolve — {{input.*}} on a subbot or emit, secrets and attachments, and a literal that cannot be its target's type ([#1497](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1497)) ([543f876](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/543f876d9abf2de85e882ac89479e79a6e68499d)), references [#1308](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1308) [#1310](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1310) [#1420](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1420) [#1505](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1505)

    A data mapping — an edge `-> dst with { ... }`, a subbot / emit node's own `with:`, or a `fail message:` — is resolved through `pkg/runtime.engine.resolveMapping`, whose `resolveRef` has no arm for the `secrets` / `attachments` namespaces and reads `input.*` against the parent's run inputs for subbot / emit where the kind has no `input:` surface. A compute node's `expr:` runs through `pkg/dsl/expr`, whose `evalNamespaces` (snapshot.go) excludes `secrets` and `attachments` deliberately — so a…

    The ticket measured `GET /api/v1/runs/stats?team_id=<id>` as "accept-and-drop": called with three different tenant ids, the endpoint returned byte-identical numbers for the caller's active team. The adversarial round on the framing found something stricter: net/http.ServeMux silently discards every unknown query parameter, so `team_id` was never "accepted" and dropped — it was never SEEN. The user-facing result is the same (an operator comparing tenants sees the wrong answer with no error), so…

### Bug Fixes

* four one-site defects — the zai hint suppresses every ambient Anthropic channel, the operator MCP refuses unknown arguments, a bot's shell finds the engine's own binary, and the dry-run report is ordered ([#1487](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1487)) ([ee80560](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ee805603d310e17c9ce3aed7d0c93ede0e9be41f)), references [#1390](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1390) [#1505](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1505) [#1335](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1335) [#1384](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1384) [#1434](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1434) [#1505](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1505)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    GitHub lifts a review request only when the REQUESTED account submits the review. On a github_app connection the review is posted by <app_slug>[bot], and an App cannot be a reviewer at all — so the request armed through webhooks.Config.ReviewRequestLogins survives the review answering it: the "review requested" pastille stays pending forever and re-adding the reviewer is not a repeatable gesture.

    `provisionHostDevbox` installs the TARGET REPO's devbox project in place, in the run's worktree. On a host whose devbox plugin registry is newer than the repository's pin, `devbox install` rewrites the tracked lock — one line, `nodejs_24@latest` `plugin_version` 0.0.4 → 0.0.5 on this machine — so the worktree differs on a tracked file before the first node runs, and every gate that reads the tree as the pass's own work (a campaign's scope gate, a clean-tree precheck, a whole-tree commit)…

    TestNoProductionPackagePassesWithSimulation walked the tree skipping four dot-directories by name. `.iterion/` was not among them — and `.iterion/worktrees/<run-id>/` holds whole COPIES of the source tree, so the sweep found pkg/dryrun/run.go and pkg/runtime/simulation.go once per kept run and reported them as production launchers. Measured on a working checkout: 12 offences, every one of them a copy of a file the sweep deliberately excludes at its real path.

    `iterion dsl migrate --to 2 --floor 3.141.0` on every workflow under examples/: the `dsl: 2` header and nothing else — no quoted literal in an example holds a backslash, so no value was re-spelled. Eight named prompts in six files now keep the 19 paragraph breaks profile 1 dropped before the text reached the model or the studio's form; each was read, each separates prose (a heading, a list, a templated value) from prose.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    iterion mirrors a bundle's skills and plugin files into <workspace>/.claude/ before the first node. On a repository that does not ignore .claude/, the ten campaign gates read the untracked mirror as the pass's uncommitted work and refused every pass (net_dirty, four times in wave 3b of #1344), and the deterministic commits that stage the whole tree committed it (16 of bmady's 43 files in one feature commit).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A shared sandbox whose WorkspaceFolder is empty is not a sandbox without a workspace. containerWorkspaceFolder already states the rule — "an explicit Spec.WorkspaceFolder wins, an empty one means the same absolute path as on the host" — and engine_resolve.go already applies it. A driver with no host filesystem cannot bind-mount anything, so it copies the workspace to that same absolute path and leaves the field empty. That is the shape every cloud run takes.

Measured: a key added for one bot served two runs of a different bot within four hours.

    MongoOAuthStore commits a record through $set, where an omitted key keeps the OLD value, while Upsert is a FULL replace — the connect/paste path builds the record from the blob it was handed and stores the whole thing. A bson `omitempty` therefore makes a field ONE-WAY: writable when non-zero, impossible to clear. The memory twin replaces its map entry outright and clears correctly, which is exactly why no in-memory test sees it.

* **sec-audit-source:** a pass that refuses to run must destroy nothing ([#1331](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1331)) ([85bff66](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/85bff66c90be7b3e24931160dbf77696c443e361))

    R24f9d8 from the gate, and it is my own fix from the round before. Removing the stale export on entry is what makes "nothing came out" mean "nothing came out of THIS pass" — but I put it at the top of the body, above the graceful-degrade probes. A pass that never gets as far as running deepsec (no binary, no usable run id, unreadable workspace) then destroyed a CONCURRENT pass's already-exported findings, and that neighbour kept claiming json_paths.deepsec while its coverage still read…

### Bug Fixes

* **sec-audit-source:** say when a deep scan cannot be shown to have covered the tree ([#1321](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1321)) ([badbacb](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/badbacb487d54c3fe79bdf7968b8d604e635bf40))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A deepsec pass that was capped, or cut short, exports the findings it did produce, exits through the same path as a complete pass, and leaves finding_count looking healthy — on a busy tree a truncated pass outnumbers a complete pass on a clean one. Nothing said which one you were reading, so a partial audit could be transmitted to a product team as a full one. That is the defect this closes, and it is the same class that cost the pilot five reports built on 13% of a repository.

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a mutant that lost its meta.json refuses, it no longer shrinks the set in silence ([#1306](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1306)) ([a92cd3d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a92cd3d7fbbf9bbd669e57f5cfcc7dbea0aa9380))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    load_mutants skipped any directory without a meta.json and said nothing. The gate then compared `detected == total` over whatever the loader had been willing to return, so a held-out set of 7 that loses 3 meta.json reports a green 4/4. That is the vacuity trap of `holdout 0/0` with a different number, and the conjunction cannot see it because both sides shrink together.

    </details>
* **subbotsource:** a relative subbot source names the file the OS reaches ([#1312](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1312)) ([596e032](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/596e032e1364125ed427962225bbd551abb71cd5)), closes [#1283](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1283), references [#1283](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1283)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two readers resolve one `subbot source:`. The bundle walk resolves the parent's directory before joining; the runtime resolver joined lexically. So through `link/parent -> real/parent`, a source `../sib/main.bot` folded to `link/sib/main.bot` — a path the kernel never produces, since it resolves the link first and only then walks `..`. A bundle that validated clean could run a different file, or none.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `collectAllRefs` walked prompts, edge with-mappings, tool commands, scripts and action params, fail messages and compute exprs — every template family except the one a NODE carries. A subbot handing its child `{{vars.depth}}` where no `depth` is declared compiled clean, and the child started with the literal text as its value.

### Bug Fixes

* **review-pr:** the repo says whether it has a fixer; the reviewer stops assuming ([#1313](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1313)) ([6a669dc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6a669dc5281d111bab4f2c40d7d3b4acc02f99a9)), closes [#1232](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1232), references [#1232](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1232)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi published `Correction : /billy` on every review carrying a finding — at the moment and in the place a developer reads the findings, which makes it the highest-traffic instruction the gate emits. On this repo it says the opposite of the contract: the zero-touch lane is off for cost, findings are the developer's through the local loop.

    A response contract generated from a Swagger 2 description refused the null that go-swagger services send for an absent relation. Forgejo sends one for assignee, milestone and merged_by on every unassigned issue, so --validate-responses on that description produced contracts refusing ordinary answers - and the cost is not a red diagnostic: a contract violation on a 2xx is marked ambiguous, has its Data cleared and is NOT retryable, so a mutation parks its run and a read fails its node, for an…

### Features

* **dsl:** refuse two edges that disagree about what a foreach iterates (C269) ([#1299](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1299)) ([38326be](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/38326bea57204895af329fccaeeb7c0b72d5f13f)), closes [#1290](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1290)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    compileEdges registers a foreach by name and keeps the FIRST declaration, so a second edge declaring the same name over a different collection or element binding was discarded in silence: the edge carried the name, the name resolved to the other definition, and the run walked a collection its author never wrote. No error, no warning.

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a loop cap expression must produce a number, not a concatenation ([#1294](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1294)) ([cdd871c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cdd871c0f806bfe3a4e1c1934e4b0ba4dc81b754)), closes [#1271](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1271)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `+` concatenates as soon as one operand is a string, and loopCapInteger accepts a numeric string - deliberately, for the LEGACY single-reference template form. The two tolerances composed: a cap written `outputs.gate.remaining + 1` over an unschema'd field holding "3" evaluated to "31" and bounded the loop at 31 instead of 4, against the run budget, with no diagnostic. Measured end to end before the fix: 32 passes where 4 was written.

### Bug Fixes

* **dsl:** bind group members and parameters per instance ([#1191](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1191)) ([557e901](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/557e901c3714420b50e2ce9acd35e66c021126e7))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A prompt whose source cannot be resolved refuses its {{include}} for a reason that belongs to the declaration and cannot differ between the group instances binding it, so a group of N members landed N identical diagnostics on one span. The budget refusals beside it already stop at the first; this one now does too.

* **runner:** retry final bank pushes and expose bank_failed ([#1194](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1194)) ([6775622](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/67756229065bfbd6c76283518820a0085bfa1f03))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    gitOpTimeout bounds one git subprocess, never the sequence. The push retry multiplies four network ops, and a run launched without --timeout carries no deadline for the live path to sit under, so the bank could pin a runner pod for attempts x ops x gitOpTimeout. bankContext now applies bankBudget on both arms, and still honours an operator who disabled per-op bounds.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `assembleEffectiveTools` promoted `ask_user` into a node's tool list whenever `interaction:` was set, unconditionally. Every sibling append in the same function is guarded by `len(effectiveTools) > 0` — board tools, runs tools, ultracode orchestration, claw's todo_write — each carrying the same comment: "Empty tools: means no restriction". The interaction branch was the only unguarded one of the class.

* two gaps the [#1258](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1258) review surfaced — Vary replaced instead of appended, and a package no CI compiles ([#1274](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1274)) ([53dd19a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/53dd19ac626576552cc66bd03442d75f38f7ba9b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Both CORS sites wrote their own token with Header().Set("Vary", "Origin"), which discards whatever a middleware upstream recorded. The loss is invisible: the response still looks correct, it is merely cacheable across a dimension it genuinely varies on, so a shared cache can hand one client's representation to another. Found while reviewing #1258, where a middleware adds a Vary token and those two handlers silently dropped it.

    The SPA fallback answered every unrouted GET with index.html, /assets/* included. A content-hashed chunk is absent for exactly one reason — the document came from a different build than the replica answering — and 200 text/html turns that into "blocked due to a disallowed MIME type", which no client can act on and which caches as a broken script.

* **connectors:** opt-in v2 response contracts, without replaying a confirmed mutation ([#1266](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1266)) ([e1c0f05](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e1c0f05f344b1ad67adf447ce82c7bb10f026b34))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Response validation is a NEW authority, not strictness switched on over the existing descriptive schemas: those are a lossy projection (nullable, oneOf, writeOnly dropped, object inferred from properties, enums stringified), so enforcing them would refuse bodies the vendor legitimately sends. Contracts live in their own responses.json, are referenced explicitly per result case, and package format v2 is selected only when they are asked for.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A resource scope is opened for ANY run carrying a bundle, contributions or a subbot node — `beginRunResources` says so — not only for a child that borrows the workspace's resources. Two places read the scope's existence as proof of borrowing, and both were wrong for the majority of runs that have one.

* **bots,server,studio:** an example is bound to its path only when it is the file it names and parses clean; fragments are written before the mains ([#1250](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1250)) ([243efe9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/243efe9c38a6bab51042f4512a832dbb6a360acb)), references [#1248](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1248)

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** the ephemeral-set notice declines per set too ([#1244](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1244)) ([dece1c0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/dece1c076b8478ee44a2d2439936dda637673c84)), references [#1149](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1149) [#1137](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1137) [#1149](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1149)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

### Bug Fixes

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A mutant's revert restores HEAD. So anything uncommitted when the gate runs is DESTROYED during the run, and every figure the gate then reports describes a tree that stopped existing partway through the measurement.

### Bug Fixes

* **studio,server:** a companion workflow that imports opens as its unit, a fragment edit reloads the open document, a lost provenance is refused ([#1235](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1235)) ([b790871](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b790871e32d35c45fc2d4d16d3df7de3a0368cc5)), references [#1225](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1225) [#1164](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1164) [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010)

### Bug Fixes

* **review-pr:** resolve the review base once, and refresh it first ([#1230](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1230)) ([25794cd](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/25794cddd1f68cc2c974633fe8e61c7d137871d0)), references [#1224](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1224) [#1224](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1224)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A review took its scope from `git merge-base <base_ref> HEAD` on the local checkout. A workspace reused across runs carries whatever `base_ref` meant when it was made, and a merge-base against a stale base lands BELOW the branch point — so every file merged into the base since falls into the diff, and the review reports on code the branch never touched as if it had.

### Features

* **golden-master:** the net HONOURS a declared lane exclusion instead of calling it noise ([#1228](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1228)) ([a4e2e01](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a4e2e012789350fa81be2d8157698464bf695003))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A multi-environment net can renounce ONE observation on ONE lane — a decision, written down and arbitrated, never a deletion. `corpus.json` already carried the declaration:

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a held-out set of zero is not a proof, and the gate now says so ([#1152](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1152)) ([3fe5ab2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3fe5ab24d291d811ce1c5a518735049f36daea69))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `oracle_gate.converged` ends on `holdout_detected == holdout_total`, its strongest clause — and `0 == 0` satisfies it. A rite whose held-out set is empty converges on a term that measured nothing, which is the no-op confirmed as a success this bot exists to refuse in other people's deliveries.

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** the seal declines per SET, never per directory ([#1149](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1149)) ([6ceb323](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6ceb32386d8672b3fa60a52b64f9cccd9c0cf64e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    seal_holdout relocates the held-out set so the hardening loop cannot read it -- the seal was a sentence in a skill until it was made mechanical. A COMMITTED set is deliberately exempt: it awaits its own gate, and moving tracked files would leave uncommitted deletions a finalize refuses to merge while burning that set's single scoring on a gate that does not own it.

## [3.145.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.144.1...v3.145.0) (2026-09-15)

### Features

* **dsl:** a bot in several files — import "lib/x.bot" read as one unit, one identity, saved by provenance ([#1225](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1225)) ([309d6c1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/309d6c1321341fbac1748644d5bac85f69a0c454)), references [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010) [#1164](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1164) [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The first piece of the multi-file unit (ADR-098 §3, lot 3 of #1010): `import` is a keyword like `dsl`, read at the head of a file — after the header and the leading comments, before any declaration (E044 otherwise) — with a quoted, relative, slash-separated `.bot` path (E045 for the rest: absolute, a drive, `..`, `\`, NUL, junk after it); the same path twice is one import. The AST carries the imports as written, the JSON document as their paths, the writer puts them back where the parser reads…

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** the merge-gate net must outlive the outage it exists for ([#1224](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1224)) ([1f30ed3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1f30ed3fca566a412b5f806944e5f12c7544aab8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A dead gating run was reachable by the reconciler's net for 60 minutes. The outage class that net exists for is a provider usage window, and a weekly one shuts for DAYS — so the net closed while the thing it guards against was still happening.

## [3.144.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.143.0...v3.144.0) (2026-09-14)

### Features

* **remote:** a CLI launch can aim a run at a repository ([#1161](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1161)) ([0c95277](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0c952778b46c88671b10090154b1fbc6e55e884e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `POST /api/runs` has accepted `repo_url` / `repo_ref` / `connection_id` all along — the cloud runner clones the repo into the workspace before sandboxing, and the inbound-webhook path sets all three. `iterion remote runs launch` exposed none of them, so the only way to launch a repo-scoped bot with a checkout was a webhook or the studio.

    The three dock presentations (closed / floating / docked-right), the lg breakpoint rule and the persistence helpers were private to FloatingChatPanel, so nothing outside /runs/:id could reuse them. They now live in @/lib/chatDock/dockState with openedDock() taking an injectable viewport width, which makes the breakpoint rule testable without a DOM. FloatingChatPanel keeps a ChatDock type alias so the run console's existing imports keep resolving.

### Bug Fixes

* **review-pr:** the merge step no longer pins a gpt review to the Claude wire ([#1160](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1160)) ([240d066](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/240d066c260b688d5182afcd6b548ba5622c5409)), references [#1150](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1150)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `mono_family` picks which reviewer JUDGES; it never moved who MERGES. `agent converge` sits on every path and carried a hardcoded `backend: "claude_code"`, so selecting the gpt family bought a review that completed and then died on the Anthropic weekly cap at the aggregation step. A family switch that still requires the other family is the half-wired shape the parity doctrine calls a defect — measured today, when the deployment's seven-day window crossed its hard cap and every claude_code run…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The executor accepted any non-nil client. A default one and the guarded one have the same type, so nothing in the path could tell them apart, and the whole SSRF posture rested on one production site remembering to pass the right one — a convention held today only by there being exactly one such site, and due to break at the second (the cloud tier, which builds its own client).

    The held-out REUSE check needs nothing the application provides: spent_fingerprints reads committed audit directories, mutant_fingerprint hashes a mutant directory, and held_meta is in hand a hundred lines earlier.

### Features

* **botscaffold:** a gallery of eight canonical shapes behind `bots create --template` and the studio builder, each held to its form (lot 1 of [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010)) ([#1114](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1114)) ([bb6b02b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/bb6b02b22d8e8d2951f01236bd7b4c118aed6889)), closes [#1110](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1110), references [#1110](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1110) [#1110](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1110)

    The five templates of the bot-creation gallery all rendered the same graph — one campaign agent, `campaign -> done`, from the one main.bot.tmpl — and differed by prompt and metadata only; the forms the catalog bots are made of (a campaign under a deterministic gate with a bounded loop and a typed fail, a reviewer fan-out with a compute convergence, a plan under a human gate, a verified action, …) existed nowhere at a size an author could read whole, and a Verified Action had no .bot instance in…

* **sec-audit:** the capped findings can travel in the envelope, so triage is not pinned to one backend ([#1141](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1141)) ([5551f72](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5551f721157eccd824c41a33e57056a6599e2a0c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    triage reads the scanner findings through json_paths — it opens the files the tool nodes wrote. That works only where triage shares a filesystem with those nodes, and exactly one backend does: the sandbox-routed claude_code. `claw` is in-process and never enters the sandbox (delegate.go: "In-process backends (claw) refuse to start when this is set"), and `codex` refuses to run inside one at all (codex.go: "cannot run inside Iterion %s sandbox with the pinned SDK").

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    deepsec exits 1 as soon as ONE batch errored, so the node's single retry is reached far more often than "the pass crashed" suggests — and it opened a FRESH run every time. Every batch the first attempt had already investigated was re-investigated and paid for again, under the same bound that had just expired, which on a large repository is the difference between finishing and timing out twice.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `"..."` DSL string is lexed in legacy escape mode unless the file opts into `## strict-escape: on` — and no bot in the catalogue does. Legacy mode keeps every \X VERBATIM, so a backslash-escaped quote survives into the shell, which reads \" as a literal quote CHARACTER. The command then runs with quotes inside its arguments instead of around them.

* **connector:** the connector catalog — deterministic nodes over generated packages (P0) ([#1119](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1119)) ([603d2a1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/603d2a1e3314252dd2995e3bfaa4a7394e13093b)), references [#1072](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1072) [#1073](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1073) [#1072](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1072) [#1092](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1092) [#1092](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1092) [#1067](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1067)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A connector's operations are data — a method, a path, flat typed params, a typed result, closed error classes — generated from the vendor's own API description and refined by an authored overlay. One model serves both offers: the deterministic `tool … action:` path and the MCP facade differ in who chooses the arguments, never in what the call is.

### Features

* **sec-audit:** the deep scanner's findings leave the pod ([#1104](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1104)) ([e68d353](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e68d3538664c15b49f77336ffeac4eef0bbccaf7))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The deep scanner writes its findings to a file inside the sandbox, and the pod is destroyed with the run. The published envelope carries the PATH, so a pass that dies AFTER it — at triage, at the jury, on a provider usage cap — takes the whole contribution with it.

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a convergence its whole fan-out failed lost every incoming mapping ([#1120](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1120)) ([4745fd9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4745fd9fd9c8b9a13ad382879bf4167024dafb64)), references [#559](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/559) [#1113](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1113) [#484](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/484) [#484](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/484) [#559](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/559) [#1113](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1113) [#1118](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1118) [#484](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/484)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    When a fan-out stabilizes without a single branch producing output — every branch failed under `best_effort` (#559), or a `fan_out_each` fanned over an empty collection (#1113, the twin site) — the convergence node ran with NO incoming `with` mapping at all. Not just the ones reading the dead branches: also the ones reading a durable parent output or a var, which the failure never touched. A `tool` node was then handed the literal `{{input.x}}` in its command, since shell rendering deliberately…

* **server:** the origin gate refused in silence, so its own safety was unobservable ([#1108](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1108)) ([5c0f3f8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5c0f3f892865a5bb1bfd42283d6f2954fd4cbb0f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Widening the CSRF boundary from 70 hand-picked handlers to every state-changing /api route left one question open: is it refusing anything it should not? The gate answered the caller with a 403 and recorded nothing, so "no legitimate client is being refused" and "we have no way to see one" produced identical evidence — an empty grep. That is how the board-MCP transport stayed an inference: sandboxed claude_code and pi POST to /api/v1/mcp/board, which the gate covers, and the claim that their…

### Features

* **dsl:** the registry's value lists are held to the compiler, a block's remedy to its host, and worktree: is checked (C142) ([#1103](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1103)) ([142755f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/142755f7cd4f57096b1542c9fdeae87d592e6471)), references [#1092](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1092) [#1084](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1084) [#1094](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1094) [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010) [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's second verdict on #1092 named the class behind two guards that lot 1a added: the registry's value lists were proven to the PARSER only, and the "outdent it to the <host>'s level" remedy was right only because every multi-host block happened to call enterBlock.

## [3.135.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.135.0...v3.135.1) (2026-09-10)

### Bug Fixes

* **runs:** a credential with no fingerprint still names the tier that paid ([#1109](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1109)) ([290b798](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/290b79838f6960e26f0320f07911bc4069db5986)), references [#1105](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1105) [#1105](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1105)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    #1105 collected the tiers inside the FINGERPRINT harvest, which is keyed on an audit identity and skips a credential that has none — setOAuthFingerprint refuses an empty stamp outright, so an unstamped forfait never even enters the map that walk reads. A run funded only by one reported no tier at all: an empty answer where the GRANTED log line says `<unstamped>`, which is the confident silence the field exists to remove, on exactly the odd credential an operator is most likely to be chasing.

## [3.135.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.134.0...v3.135.0) (2026-09-10)

### Features

* **runs:** a run says which tier paid for it, and says it again after a resume ([#1105](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1105)) ([75e4413](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/75e441320c46d17a96186e04a5c575cf8ac88716)), closes [#991](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/991), references [#992](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/992)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `run.bot_source_tier` answers "which bundle served this launch". Nothing answered the question an operator asks at least as often — "who paid for this run?" — although the publisher computes it: it resolves the credential through five tiers and names the winner in ONE INFO line. Answering for a run whose logs have rotated meant not answering at all.

### Features

* **dsl:** a property registry the parser is held to, and E012 names the remedy (lot 1a of [#1010](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1010)) ([#1092](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1092)) ([57564e7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/57564e765e5bc8ef4c5c34d02752da6ecba7fd47)), closes [#1084](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1084), references [#1084](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1084) [#1094](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1094)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Lot 1a of #1010 (#1084). The DSL's property surface was written by hand in five places (the parser's switch arms, the EBNF, the readable grammar, the root SKILL.md, the whats-next quickref) and drifted: the quickref's canonical examples did not parse until lot 0 rewrote them, and an unknown property was refused with E012 and a pointer to a table.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The admin per-credential route answers for ONE tier and defaults to `platform` when the caller names none — correct, since no tenant view can show that tier, and nothing in the response said so. Both routes also labelled every answer with a `month` they derived from `time.Now()`, while reading no `?month=` at all: a caller asking for August was served September, byte for byte, under an August-shaped question.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A FIXER run holds no required check. markGateInFlight claims `gate_context`, and a fixer has none — it answers a review rather than gating the merge — so for the tens of minutes it works, NOTHING on the pull request says it is there. The only signal that ever existed is a comment, and only in one case: a quota park, whose pause notice already tells the reader not to push. A fixer that is simply working is silent.

    `buildOrgTree` lists every team of an org for its admins, synthesizing a `RoleAdmin` grant — deliberately, since `canManageTeam`/`orgAdminOfTeam` already let them write to each of those teams. `SwitchTeam` never learned the same rule: it had a step-in for super-admins only, so every other team came back `403 user is not a member of the team`. The studio builds its switcher from the first and calls the second, so the click did nothing at all, with no message. Measured on prod: 19 teams offered,…

    The store held exactly one OAuthRecord per (owner, kind), enforced by a unique index.

    The AST JSON codec is what a cloud launch puts on the queue and what the studio saves through. It dropped four constructs: `group` / `use` (a workflow using them compiled from its .bot and failed with C008/C001 after the round-trip), the `as foreach` clause on an edge (silently gone) and a named resource pool (`slot: ["a", "b"]` came back as a bare capacity). So a bot with any of them behaved differently on a cloud launch than locally. The codec now mirrors every declaration — groups through…

    A CLI delegate reports ONE token count and no split.

    The mid-run workspace checkpoint force-pushes the pod's tree as `iterion/run-<id>-checkpoint` on the run's OWN remote — the repository the bot was pointed at — and reads that tree with `git add -A`, so a bot's scratch directory rides along: untracked, and nothing ignores it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The App-token mint signs its JWT from a stored private key BEFORE it opens a socket, so a key that is not parseable PEM fails inside what reads like a pure remote call. Three handlers default to 502 for anything the classifier does not recognise — a sound default, since an unclassified failure on a forge round trip really is the forge's — and they were reporting GitHub as broken for iterion's own stored key.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The gate refused on ANY two byte-identical references, unconditionally. Its own message said the refusal is not always right — "on a refusal lane two entries legitimately capture the same 302, and the second is a control proving a mutant moved only the first" — and then offered no way to say so. The corpus answered in `note`, which is prose, and the gate reads data. So a net whose duplicates were every one of them justified could never converge.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Provisioning short-circuits when the bot set and the event set already match, and that test never looked at the address the forge is actually calling.

    `recordBudget` runs on the success path only. A node that failed returned its result beside the error — with the pass's cost stamped on it, which is what the delegate has always done and what two fixes today made reliable — and nothing read it. So the run's totals, the daily spend cap and a lending donor's ledger all missed whatever the failing node burned. On a long agent node that is a whole session, and the runs that fail are exactly the ones that burned the most.

    Sharing a key across an org's product teams had no home. The API-key walk only sees the team's and the user's rows, and secrets.OrgOwnerKey — despite its name — keys a TEAM forfait.

One such forge therefore pinned the public URL of the WHOLE deployment: moving to a new domain meant either leaving that forge behind or not moving.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Surface the latest successful checkpoint event in inspection and unavailable commit listings, with provenance and a quoted fetch hint. Preserve no_baseline, final-bank fields and merge eligibility; report read failures and require validation of recovered work. Closes #972.

    Addresses R6a7f93. The custom-workdir path streamed `cd '<dir>' && exec bash -c '<script>'` through `sh -s`. That keeps the script off the HOST argv, but the in-pod shell then re-issues execve("bash", ["bash", "-c", "<script>"]) — and MAX_ARG_STRLEN applies to that exec too. E2BIG was relocated into the pod, not removed, for precisely the shape this streaming exists to serve: an oversized `<shell> -c <script>` combined with a non-default WorkDir.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on a live campaign: a lot filed an extension request in one commit and acted it in the next — added the reference, appended the act block — and the harness's provenance rule, which refuses a request and an act introduced by the SAME commit, saw nothing; the lot's own file became a reference of the net that judges it, exempted as a pure addition, and the lot landed with a caveat.

    #871 made every launch surface resolve `team -> platform -> baked`, so a team's fork now runs on its board cards, triggers, schedules and webhooks. The reads that describe those launches stayed on platform-over-baked, so the same delivery ran the fork and was described by the origin — with no diagnostic, because both answers are well-formed.

    The ChatGPT-Codex backend gates model availability on the `version:` header; iterion resolved it from a host `codex --version` probe and let that value win over claw's baked release. A stale binary in an image then downgraded every OAuth call: measured 2026-09-07 on the cloud runner (codex-cli 0.139.0 shipped in the image), the backend answered "The 'gpt-6-astra' model requires a newer version of Codex" while the same model is served to the 0.144.6 release claw now presents.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ListAllArtifacts walked runs/<id>/artifacts on the local filesystem and returned an empty list when the directory was absent — which is every run on a cloud server pod, since the directory lives on the runner that wrote it. Measured 2026-09-07: a run whose events carried two artifact_written entries (one of them a `publish:`) answered `{"artifacts": []}` on GET /api/runs/{id}/artifacts while GET /api/runs/{id}/artifacts/{node}/0 served the body.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `POST /runs/{id}/raise-budget` on a run busy inside a long node answers "queued … the run is busy in a long node and will apply it at its next boundary — it is not lost". For `bump_loop` that is true. For the budget it was false in the one case the command exists for.

    The kubernetes driver passed a `sh -c <script>` recipe to `kubectl exec` as a single argv element. Linux caps ONE argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (32 pages = 128 KiB) — a limit no ulimit raises — so a large interpolated recipe fails the fork with E2BIG before the pod is ever contacted:

    The claude CLI announces its session id on `system/init`, the first thing it emits. It was logged there and dropped.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    On a needs-attention card, Retry only restages the ticket and lets whoever claims it decide what "retry" meant: the studio's admission loop mints a fresh run, a live `iterion dispatch` resolves `last_run_id` and RESUMES the dead one from its checkpoint (resolveRunID -> LastRunForIssue -> resumableRunID). So on a dispatcher-owned board Retry is effectively *Resume* — beside a menu that already offers "Resume from checkpoint" as a separate, deliberate action. For a run that died in a way resuming…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A tool node runs its recipe through `exec.CommandContext(ctx, "bash", "-c", …)` without Setpgid, so cancellation killed the shell and nothing else. A job the recipe backgrounded survived, kept the inherited stdout pipe open, and `cmd.Output()` never returned: the run reported cancelled while the work it paid for ran to completion — burning wall-clock, a cloud pod, and writing the workspace that finalization was about to capture.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `resolveBotSource` — the chokepoint the board dispatcher, the trigger spine, the cloud scheduler and the inbound webhooks all cross — hardcoded an empty team id, so the team tier of `team -> platform -> baked` applied on the studio button alone. A team that forked a catalog bot in the studio editor ran its fork by hand and the baked/platform bundle on every board card, trigger, schedule and webhook review, with no diagnostic: documented as functional while inert.

    A corpus that declares a file field had it flattened by `urlencode`, which serialises a structured value through its repr: the application received a form field whose value was the TEXT of a Python object, refused the request for the wrong reason, and the reference recorded THAT refusal as the behaviour. An observation point that cannot express its own request observes nothing — and the lot that needed one stopped, correctly, rather than record two rejections as if they were the product.

    The run's Claude Code / Codex forfait is delivered into the sandbox and seeded into CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME after start, but only the claude_code and claw delegates pointed their own spawns at those dirs.

No sample differs and no wait helps, so the automatic resume above it can only spend pods to be told the same thing.

### Features

* **golden-master:** the two debts behind a 0/0 held-out figure are fields, not sentences ([#901](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/901)) ([0d7ffe3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0d7ffe3ff94ba751a9e0c0c204d122004b5df670))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The gate line checks `holdout_detected == holdout_total`, which is vacuously true at 0/0. The report already said so — in a NOTICE, and this file's own comment names why that is not enough: "a notice string is where debts go to hide". One of the two debts got a field when it was measured (`holdout_awaiting_gate`); the other stayed prose.

    A delegation that ends badly still SPENT. The caps, the fallback chain's carried spend and a donor's ledger all read the cost from the output map, so a terminal return that skips the stamp records nothing — the money is gone either way, only the accounting disappears. `typedFailure` exists as that choke point, and its own docstring says so; two returns walked past it.

    On a driver whose workspace is a tar COPY inside a pod, nothing a run produces leaves that pod before teardown: the export runs once, at the end, and every push the runner performs reads the exported clone.

    The terminal sink (ADR-096 §5) protects a card from a MACHINE resurrecting it. A drag on the bound GitHub board is not a machine: it is the operator's hand, arriving through the only channel they have.

    ChainHooks composed 18 of the 22 func fields and dropped OnAssistantText, OnUsageCap, OnUsageProgress and OnOrchestrationStall. runview chains every ExtraHooks entry through it, so any run launched with one — the Prometheus exporter (ITERION_PROMETHEUS_ADDR) is the shipped case — lost those four event families silently: no live usage_progress for a supervisor's cost_gt monitor, no usage_cap, no delegate_stall, no assistant text in the timeline.

* **server,cloudpublisher:** the board dispatcher launches through the org gate, a run no credential tier can fund is refused at publish, and a launch give-up reaches the needs-attention lane ([#850](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/850)) ([0841f18](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0841f182ffac421f535ad017421545ba00a00df2)), closes [#841](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/841)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A card the dispatcher gave up on before any run existed (the launch attempt cap) carried a give-up stamp with no run id, and GiveUp.Current was bound to a run id, so the pipeline board filed the card among the done tickets: a card nobody could launch was invisible. The stamp now carries a `launch` marker — current for the card in its state whatever run it points at, part of the stamp's identity, round-tripped by both store twins — and the ticket card (or the run card of an older attempt) takes…

### Bug Fixes

* **runner,runtime,sandbox:** a stale launch redelivery never restarts a requeued run, the resumed budget is re-stamped post-clamp, and the kubernetes post_create phase is bounded ([#822](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/822)) ([193585f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/193585f531981e17c715c89caecd9628979ba8a0)), closes [#714](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/714) [#718](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/718) [#719](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/719) [#723](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/723) [#720](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/720)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `queued` doc is the one status runResolveDoc restarts from the entry node, so a redelivery that reaches it from an earlier life of the run re-spends everything the checkpoint exists to save. The admission gauntlet now reads the queued arm explicitly: a launch message published before the doc's current QueuedAt belongs to a finished attempt and is dropped (the attempt now queued carries its own delivery), and a queued doc holding a checkpoint resumes instead of restarting.

    Two fetchers sharing a cache dir both stage the same key; the first rename(staging → final) wins and the loser's fails ENOTEMPTY. The loser already re-read the final path and accepted it — but that read could find NOTHING, because publish renames an existing tree ASIDE before its own rename. With N publishers the sequence is: A publishes, B's rename loses, C retires the path to make room for its own copy, and B — reading between C's retire and C's rename — sees no final path and reports…

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** a terminal verdict on the formatting pass is returned, not retried; a structured answer is an answer; a 403 is a refusal ([#845](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/845)) ([8202bcf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8202bcffbc4706fcde475d52827ef4a95a836d4a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Third review round of the facade-render fix. The formatting loop assigned every rendered verdict to fmtErr and retried the attempt once, so a dead credential, an unavailable model or an exhausted window bought a second CLI spawn against a provider that had just refused, and re-filed the same usage evidence. Only the transient class is retried now (renderRetryable); the rest returns typed at once, as the recovery pass already did.

* **billy:** a delivery reserve out of the duration cap, a typed decline the platform honours, a structural drift gate, and no masked exit status in verify.sh ([#830](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/830)) ([5166823](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/51668231d8704c8af6d5466a1a3970ff176227f3)), closes [#789](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/789) [#779](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/779) [#705](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/705) [#706](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/706), references [#770](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/770) [#705](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/705) [#706](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/706) [#779](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/779) [#789](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/789)

    has_drift_gate read the verify script one line at a time and counted a quiet diff only when the failing exit appeared on the SAME line, so the commonest real shape -- a multiline "if ! git diff --quiet ...; then ... exit 1; fi", which is what this repo's own openapi:check target writes -- was rejected. Run 01a072b5 delivered eight commits, logged VERIFY OK, and still returned exit 3 / DRIFT GATE MISSING, leaving the merge gate red on a green tree.

* **forge,webhooks:** one App client per connection with its real slug, tokens minted from the recorded grant, a 403 that arms the preflight, a connection-first reply gate, and a GitLab fork MR that names its source ([#846](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/846)) ([e2b5fe7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e2b5fe70a695ac2e78dfd22992f08ba612878496)), closes [#711](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/711) [#710](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/710) [#717](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/717) [#708](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/708) [#728](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/728), references [#711](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/711)

* **golden-master:** the harness reverts a mutant an interrupted gate left applied, at the start of the next ([#807](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/807)) ([7a70bbc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7a70bbc53d082e4356c9441f866ced1b6a940d61)), references [#799](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/799)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A stream cut, a SIGTERM or a pod kill between apply.sh and revert.sh leaves a mutant in the tree. The next gate on that tree judged a mutated program and called it the lot's: measured on a verify node retried on the same tree after its exec stream broke at 7 676 s — the oracle reported the mutant's file as "not committed", the build gate went red on a package that exists on the bank, and the run finished not converged with hours of budget left.

* **server:** a publish grant must belong to the run that carries it ([#849](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/849)) ([0aab3d2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0aab3d2b583017a70e9ac103a0555e8c998bc434)), closes [#825](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/825)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The publish token is a launch VAR, and injectForgePublishVars honours a caller-pinned one. Every reader then proved the grant SELF-consistent — its connection belongs to its team, its repo matches the pull request, its host matches the connection — and a grant minted for another tenant passed all of them. None asked whether that tenant was the run's. So an authenticated operator of team B holding a team-A token could have iterion comment on team A's pull request, write team A's REQUIRED commit…

Same launch pair (<base>.CloneURL + the PR's head branch), so a head branch that does not live in the base repo could be checked out against a same-named branch of the base repo and a code-pushing bot would commit onto it.

* **runner:** the per-run clone's git commands leave no maintenance process behind ([#829](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/829)) ([da8a2f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/da8a2f0bc8278e4ca206ffcf4a56e735415cbb6b)), closes [#821](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/821), references [#813](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/813) [#821](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/821) [#828](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/828)

* **runtime,bots:** an oracle that never ran is not a RED — the run-files env var goes with its bind, the report goes to a temp file of the run ([#815](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/815)) ([f517637](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f5176376a1f74cd1888feeec5aa79d0bce624807)), references [#795](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/795) [pre-#795](https://github.com/pre-/issues/795)

    Measured on the pod backend, four modernize lots in one night: gate green, references intact, and "oracle RED" on one line — the gate wrapper's `cannot create /iterion/artifact-files/gm-last-report.json: Directory nonexistent`. The harness never ran: the redirect died first. One lot diagnosed it and blocked, two were stopped by the loop budget guard, one spent 173 minutes repairing an environment. Some 20 run-hours, no verdict.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The `__claw-runner` relay carried the LLM steps (#805) and nothing else, so everything the in-container loop observed died at the container boundary: the studio timeline of a sandboxed claw node showed LLM steps and no tools, an in-container permission denial left no audit, a supervisor's `tool_*` monitor never armed, the plan checklist stayed empty, a retry or a compaction round read as a silent gap, and `iterion fork --turn` had no anchor at all.

    A failed WhoAmI now takes three shapes instead of one. A credential the forge rejects outright is the reconnect problem the revoked-status rung already names — a 422, forced or not, because no force can carry an upload the forge would refuse the same way. A forge that answered but would not describe the account (insufficient scope) is the one case the operator can vouch for: a 409 unforced, tolerated under force. Anything else — a spent budget, an unreachable forge, a 5xx — is not an answer: a…

    An avatar apply on a connection of unknown kind asks the forge who the token is.

* **server:** a forced apply bails when /user never answers; the card vouches only on a 409 ([#804](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/804)) ([66e63b5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/66e63b5674318528632b4d63e47a83bc83c4eda5)), references [#803](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/803)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's gate on #803 (R77fadf, R4a0ce8) and its assumptions: - Under force, a WhoAmI failure was swallowed even when it was the apply's own deadline expiring — the upload then ran on a dead context and stamped "context deadline exceeded" on the connection, blaming the avatar for a forge that does not answer. A genuine refusal is still tolerated; a spent budget bails with the accurate reason and records nothing. - The card sent force:true for every account not flagged as a bot, so the 409 branch…

* **server:** the avatar record rides its own budget, not the round-trips' deadline ([#803](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/803)) ([75e8d0e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/75e8d0e400bf2bb832f2b48ae09e50b2a6b576c2)), references [#800](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/800)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's gate on #800 (R8b0bd7): giving the apply one bounded context put the outcome record under the same 20 s deadline as the upload — so the slow forge, the failure worth recording, expired the context first and the record never ran (and an upload landing near the deadline answered 502 for an avatar that was live). The record now takes a 10 s budget of its own, detached from the round-trips; a forge that hangs is proved to leave its reason on the connection.

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** resolve the template snapshot on every dispatch path — a fan-out branch, the llm router and llm_or_human rendered {{run.*}} and {{outputs.*}} as literals ([#796](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/796)) ([72275c0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/72275c0ff80a7af8cd398067f5060608239a4ba0)), closes [#763](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/763), references [#763](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/763) [#763](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/763)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `model.WithRunID` / `WithTemplateData` were attached on the trunk dispatch path only, so the SAME node rendered two ways depending on how it was reached. Inside a `fan_out_all` / `fan_out_each` body a prompt kept its literal `{{outputs.x.y}}` braces and a tool `command:` substituted an EMPTY string for `{{run.id}}` — a silent constant, not a visible failure. The llm router and the `llm_or_human` LLM half never had the snapshot either.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The platform pods (server, runner) and the sandboxed run pods carried no PriorityClass, so a run pod bursting on a node committed at 99 % of its requests was a peer of the runner that owns its run for the scheduler and for eviction. `server.priorityClassName` / `runner.priorityClassName` (empty = the cluster default) let a deployment rank the platform above the run pods it starts (SocialGouv/iterion#732: prod sets both to the cluster's `resource-burstable`; the run pods stay unclassed).

    ReconcileStatusOptions reported a LostColumn only on the pass that observed the loss: both append sites were guarded by `id != ""` and that same pass dropped the cached id. From the next pass on the state had no id, so `rep.Lost` was empty and `rep.Reason()` was "" — and the caller, reading "nothing lost", cleared `degraded` on the first unrelated adoption. The lost column then read healthy forever while every reflect onto it still refused, counted in `reflect_no_column` and invisible…

    A declined back-edge emitted budget_warning {remaining, needed, used, limit}; read on a run with more remaining than needed, it did not say why the loop stopped — the rule is that the next iteration would land at or past the 90 % threshold where the engine refuses to start any node, and remaining > needed does not contradict it. Measured on a run whose repair loop was declined with remaining 15 644 s and needed 13 154 s: used 13 156 + needed 13 154 = 26 310 ≥ 25 920 (90 % of 28 800). The event…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's gate on #794: the runbook handed the PIC operator the non-forced avatar command for connections that predate AccountKind — every one of them answered 409 needs_force, because the field is written at connect time only. The apply now asks the forge who the token is when the field is empty and records what it learns, so the bot gate judges the account and a group-token bot user needs no --force; a person's PAT still does.

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a loop is priced on any entry into its body; a stale run-start mark is re-based on resume ([#783](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/783)) ([d69189a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d69189ae8bd4d647c2fd076556ef73d26c62b4f3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The loop budget guard prices the next iteration by the last one, from a mark set when the loop is entered from outside. That mark was only set when the body was entered at the loop's HEAD (loop.Entries). A campaign bot's extension loop is entered elsewhere: its body shares the verify and gate nodes with the lot's own repair loop, so the run reaches it at verify, off its head, and the loop kept the mark the session baseline had set at run start. Its first crossing was then priced at everything…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    branch-improve-loop's plan-phase guard measured its own wall clock in `plan_scope_probe` (a `started_epoch` stamp) and compared spend against two vars mirroring the `budget:` block by hand. Both were workarounds for primitives that did not exist; both are now defects. A mirror var is not reached by `iterion run --max-cost-usd 200`, so a re-budgeted run kept refusing against the literal 75 nobody had updated — the guard's arithmetic silently disagreeing with the budget the run was actually under.

    #766 made a child execute in its parent's sandbox on the cloud runner and in the studio's in-process service — and left the third host out: the CLI's subbot runner built the child engine without the parent's sandbox facts and without a workdir, so the child defaulted to the process cwd (engine.go: workDir defaults to os.Getwd() at Run time). A parent that swapped to a per-run worktree therefore handed its child the BASE tree: whatever the child committed landed in a tree the parent's gate never…

    A node that wants to reason about the run's budget -- "planning has used a third of max_duration, stop planning" -- had nothing to read: the `run` namespace resolved only `run.id`, and the `budget:` block's caps were compile-time literals. PR #737 had to self-measure wall-clock in a tool node and mirror the budget through two hand-maintained vars that drift from the block in silence; every phase-budget guard would have repeated it.

    The harness is the net's decision procedure. Its content belongs to the net's owner and changes through a rite; its code is this bundle's and is repaired upstream — and until now the only path for a repaired judge into a tree that judges with it was a full rite: hours of agent work and a fresh held-out cycle for a one-line fix in a file no agent may edit.

    Measured on the first subbot to run on a cloud pod: under the kubernetes driver the child engine started a sandbox of its own, the driver copies the workspace into a pod, so the child's commits lived in its copy and died with it (final_branch null, the commit unreachable from anywhere) while the parent, parked on the subbot node, resumed and re-judged an unchanged tree.

* **sandbox:** the claw bind-mount follows the effective backend; a pod that never got placed parks the run failed_resumable ([#760](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/760)) ([cdcd63b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cdcd63b8fdb39187876df034b9112b2fc7d650f2)), closes [#724](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/724) [#699](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/699)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `containsClawNode` read each node's declared `backend:` and `fallbacks:` only. Launch-time model/backend overrides (`--backend '*=claw'`, `--model`, the studio override object, `RunMessage.model_overrides`) are applied at dispatch and never folded into the IR, so a workflow of `claude_code` nodes run with `--backend '*=claw'` got no in-container iterion binary: every node died on `exec: /usr/local/bin/iterion: no such file or directory`, and `sandbox_claw_routed_via_runner` stayed silent.

* **store/mongo:** New retries a late server selection; the CI replica-set init fails without a PRIMARY ([#754](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/754)) ([d6e7985](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d6e798548fb2c19268a9a11868e227e434801ea7)), closes [#729](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/729), references [#698](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/698)

    A fresh client's first server selection can outlast a single 5 s ping on a loaded host while the replica set is healthy — the handshake is late, not the primary absent. New pinged once and turned that lag into a boot failure, and into a conformance harness that ejected a green PR from the merge queue (#729: "rs0 primary elected" printed, then the 5th fresh client saw ReplicaSetNoPrimary and PR #698 was thrown out).

### Bug Fixes

* **webhooks:** the GitLab note handler routes every slash command generically — /revi approve and the fork guard reach GitLab ([#753](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/753)) ([6f336f4](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6f336f4a8f8b5b95bb8d29e557991f303607000d)), closes [#683](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/683)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    GitLab addresses merge requests as a REST resource separate from issues (an MR and an issue can share the same iid in one project), so CommentIssue's /issues/:iid/notes endpoint would land on, or 404 against, the wrong resource for a caller replying on an MR. Adds the MR-scoped counterpart posting to /merge_requests/:iid/notes, needed by the upcoming GitLab /revi approve reply lane.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The three refresh paths did Get -> RefreshRecord -> whole-record Upsert, so a rename committed between the read and the persist was reverted to the label the refresh had read a provider round trip earlier. The rename side was already a store-level $set (SetAccountLabel); this is its mirror.

* **runner:** wire a SubbotRunner into the cloud runner — subbot nodes ran locally only ([#743](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/743)) ([1716b9e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1716b9e266328332bdc5757012da92f544fb61d1))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The pod's engine was built without WithSubbotRunner (pkg/runner/loop.go), while the CLI and the studio paths carried one. Every `subbot` node on a cloud run therefore died at dispatch with `subbot "x": no SubbotRunner is wired` — a net's extension subbot, its re-anchor subbot, and a programme supervisor's per-lot child all existed locally only. "No feature ships local-only", violated by the one surface that runs unattended.

* **claw:** carry the run's forfait across the sandbox boundary (it currently cannot authenticate there at all) ([#744](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/744)) ([edd5b9d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/edd5b9dcfee2a2ad3a14501a95831d99a9f51520)), closes [#736](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/736) [#698](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/698), references [#698](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/698) [#687](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/687) [#698](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/698) [#736](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/736) [#687](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/687)

    in-process generation — supervisor evals, GenerateObjectDirect — which is what fixed #687's pacer. It did not hold for `backend: claw` AGENT nodes on a cloud pod, which are the DEFAULT shape: production runs ITERION_SANDBOX_DEFAULT=auto with an empty override, so those execute sandboxed and the in-container __claw-runner rebuilds its registry from env alone.

### Bug Fixes

* **bots:** the plan phase can no longer eat the delivery budget; only_lot on a non-actionable lot fails typed ([#737](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/737)) ([b2b3616](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b2b3616b03b67c6d9e30f47646cce35b5dcfb882)), references [iterion#683](https://github.com/iterion/issues/683)

    Two production runs on iterion#683 spent the whole planning chain (plan -> plan_review -> plan_revise) for 150 min / $8.59 combined and never reached campaign, the node that writes code (native:695). The chain had no ceiling of its own, so it could freely spend the entire run's max_duration / max_cost_usd budget on an optional enrichment (ADR-091) before the actual delivery work ever started.

* **golden-master:** an extension act already present at base is not re-judged ([#735](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/735)) ([292e3f6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/292e3f65a577a46b05096ebc7f14aa02e1950726))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    extension_verdict judged EVERY act in the ledger at HEAD against the run's base. An act introduced before that base has, by construction, its added references in the base tree — so every one of them read as "existed at base — a rewrite wearing an addition's name", and the certifier refused a net that had done nothing wrong.

    </details>
* **quota:** a reading is trusted for a bounded time, the retry waits for the nearest key, the ceiling counts spenders, the stamp is visible ([#730](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/730)) ([f25d224](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f25d2240408b0f96a41988adf8032977aa89ec81)), references [#690](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/690) [#684](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/684) [#661](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/661) [#659](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/659) [#659](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/659) [#690](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/690) [#690](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/690) [#684](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/684) [#661](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/661) [#659](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/659) [#690](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/690)

    A reading carrying a reset instant was trusted until that instant, however old. The provider resets windows early: on 2026-09-04 the ledger held 93-99% seven_day readings taken before such a reset, every credential walk skipped both forfaits on them and every claude_code run was refused at admission — the revi/review gate of two PRs with them — for a reset four days out. The lock was self-sustaining: the only writer of a fresh reading is a live session's rate_limit_event, and the refusal is…

    Two paid failures in prod, hours apart, were accepted silently by the server: a claude_code accessToken pasted as a terminal transcript (embedded newlines/ANSI escapes) and a claude_code record missing expiresAt/scopes — the shape the CLI reads as "Not logged in". Both lived on disk after ingestion, so every downstream call from a full fleet of runs would die on 401 for hours before the cause was found.

    A link written /dsl is SITE-absolute: every static-site generator routes it from the site root. os.path.join drops everything left of an absolute path, so the scanner asked the filesystem for /dsl and reported it dead. On prod run 01a055f9 that was 20 of the 22 hints, every one false, and the remaining 2 were explicit HTML anchors the heading-only collector could not see.

    The publish tail spoke one platform: the SSP Cloud datalab (three S3 STS secrets with a 7-day life and a standing serve service), which let the demo URL die by itself and put platform literals in the DSL.

### Bug Fixes

* **forge:** a re-provision keeps a schedule row's id, vars and last fire; Doki 3.5.6 declares its schedule vars ([#673](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/673)) ([7cbf526](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7cbf5262bc346ff579ee8c4afb4078f8dd7aaadd))

    syncSchedules rebuilds an integration's schedule rows from the manifests on every re-provision and carried cron, pause and guard tuning over — but not the vars the operator set, nor last_fire_at, and it minted a new id each time. The docs-refresh weekly lost its open_mr/mode twice that way (07-27, 09-03: the second time from a re-provision that enabled another bot), ran a multi-hour full sweep and shipped nothing, while runs and audit entries kept pointing at a schedule id that no longer…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Nothing on an OAuth record said WHOSE account it was. The payload is sealed, the API view exposed neither a label nor the fingerprint, and the only place the credential is ever identified is a server log line the publisher writes when it picks one (fp=700acc7b…). Answering "whose subscription paid for that run?" therefore meant grepping logs and correlating hex by hand — measured today, with three fingerprints across three owners in one window.

    Two lines apart, expandWildcards hard-fails a wildcard whose MCP server cannot boot and merely warns when that server booted with no tools. The asymmetry is correct — #633 established that ambient servers (target repo .mcp.json, plugin catalog) degrade per-server upstream in buildTask, so a wildcard reaching this function is a DECLARED dependency and must never be dropped in silence — but nothing at the code site said so, and the error named neither the declaration nor a way out.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The codex CLI hard-errors on any non-noop sandbox driver at dispatch — so a codex stage on a sandboxed node fails EXACTLY when the fallback chain is needed, which is worse than not having it. ApplyRunFallback now resolves each node's effective sandbox mode (node override → workflow spec → the deployment's ITERION_SANDBOX_DEFAULT snapshot, threaded through ExecutorSpec from both the cloud runner and the local service) and refuses the stage with the same launch-time voice as the other C176…

* **forge:** refresh lead must exceed the tick period, or a token phase-locks onto its own expiry ([#649](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/649)) ([1417654](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1417654fbb946051c352377dc3aa95cc6eab5d8b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The refresh worker only renews connections expiring within Lead (was 5m), swept every 10m: a 1h installation token could go from "not yet due" to "expired" between two ticks, the refresh then landing AT expiry — and since each mint inherits that phase, the connection locks onto an always-refreshed-at-death cycle. Any run whose launch minute sits just before the lock point is sealed a token with seconds of life: its clone barely makes it, its state push and NATS redeliveries die on it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A provider that freezes an account for 'usage pattern' violations publishes NO numeric bound to adapt to: the refusal message names no frequency, the 200s carry no rate headers, and the threshold only reveals itself by tripping it — which is how a whole fleet ended up frozen behind one credential.

    The cost cap (max_cost_usd) is the money guard; the duration cap only needs to catch a genuinely hung run.

One token-less repo server (the repo-scoped sentry on runner pods, which have no SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN) therefore killed every claw node of a run at plan_review — observed 3× on 2026-09-02, neutralising the zero-touch fixer lane on this repo…

    Re-resolution is already universal server-side (SubmitResume and the retry sweeper both re-resolve), yet a structurally-broken credential kept condemning run after run: it filled its slot on every resolution, gated the pool and platform tiers off, and its failure produced NO evidence for the credential-tier skip to act on. Quota refusals have a family, frequency refusals have a family — the provider rejecting the credential ITSELF had none.

* **secrets:** several keys of one provider become an ordered fallback chain ([#612](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/612)) ([7ff4007](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7ff4007c06ed7db256bbe824148e03d42735f89d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Completes the credential chain the fair-usage freeze exposed: the BYOK tier resolved ONE fixed key per provider, so a key whose account the provider froze was resealed into every fresh launch until an operator removed it by hand (measured 2026-09-02: two removals, five cancels, three relaunch waves).

## [3.89.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.88.0...v3.89.0) (2026-09-02)

### Features

* **webhooks:** an explicitly named review identity lights the re-request lane on GitHub ([#605](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/605)) ([9ff26bc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9ff26bc47c2bc746911c7de1013c8bc3a7b4afce)), references [#604](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/604) [#608](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/608) [#608](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/608)

    Rebuilt as one commit on main after #604 merged and #608 landed the GitHub/Forgejo replier gate there (convergent fix — both Revi loops demanded it); this is the remaining delta. Four Revi rounds on the PR (3→3→5→0 findings, all real) shaped it; every behaviour guard is mutation-verified.

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** a fair-usage refusal parks the run and feeds the credential skip — not the node's answer ([#610](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/610)) ([dade12e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/dade12e7626a94ee8af8c7a103470711f5afe27e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured 2026-09-02: a provider account under a fair-usage frequency restriction refused EVERY request with a ~330-char relayed 429. The one-liner length cap kept isRateLimitMessage from seeing it, so the refusal text became the agent's output (a campaign node 'finished' with the error as its work_remaining); two modernize lots burned ~7h each overnight and two rites spun full passes on it in minutes.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The tiers were a fixed first choice, not a chain: a run whose tenant (or the platform) holds an OAuth forfait was never eligible for any later tier, INCLUDING when that forfait's provider window was closed. The run got the exhausted credential, spent one LLM call to be refused, and parked until the window reset - up to a week on the weekly one - while a second forfait or the mutualised pool could have served it immediately.

## [3.86.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.86.0...v3.86.1) (2026-09-01)

### Bug Fixes

* **webhooks:** the re-request replier gate reaches the prforge lane; an authz error never strands a co-riding resync ([#608](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/608)) ([524dabf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/524dabf83c77fc858968985cccac51f93abad4e8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    TestBudgetGraceCoversDuration slept 350ms against a 570ms graced ceiling, leaving ~220ms for engine overhead — a loaded CI runner spends more than that and the run correctly dies past the ceiling, failing the test (seen ejecting merge-queue entries). Scaled to 2s/2.3s/3.8s: same contract, ~1.5s of slack.

### Features

* **server:** the outcome router — a terminal run is decided by its contract, once per episode ([#599](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/599)) ([5436277](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5436277408f2016d78e218eec1b4409659ce7a45)), references [#1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1) [#595](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/595) [#597](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/597) [#607](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/607)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The measured class, one campaign, 48h: a converged run waited 8h51 for a human; a run marked 'handled' by its external observer was redelivered, worked 6h, converged, and was never looked at again; a third landed while carrying an explicit blocker and reddened every downstream launch. The decision lived outside the authority that knows the state — an external script guessing from a stale copy.

### Features

* **webhooks:** on-demand re-review via the forge-native re-request button; per-repo merge-gate opt-out ([#604](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/604)) ([c5eb318](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c5eb31847c545dadaf61f98c888a3787e77fb8c6)), references [iterion#300](https://github.com/iterion/issues/300)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An operator who pins gate_enabled=false on a repo integration turns the review bot advisory-only — no commit status ever lands — so the statuses-scope derivation that forces re-review-on-sync (whose sole purpose is keeping a REQUIRED check alive across pushes) no longer applies. The pin now disables the forcing on fresh provisions AND releases an already-forced sync through the backfill, in both cases surviving re-provisions — unlike a bare review_on_sync PATCH, which the next provision…

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** refuse team-less identities at the auth choke — no more empty-tenant panics on /api/runs* (Sentry ITERION-13/-1W/-1Z) ([#606](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/606)) ([097de77](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/097de77f2a103d187ac4258ea5eb393b7ccadc2c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An authenticated identity whose TeamID resolved empty (a PAT minted with no team whose owner has no default team, a GitHub-gated user before any grant) sailed through requireAuth and reached the Mongo store with an EMPTY tenant in ctx — the store's fail-closed guard then panicked on every request: a recovered 500 for the caller, steady-state Sentry noise burying real crashes (ITERION-13/-1W/-1Z, 1800+ events since 2026-08-24 on GET /api/runs, GET /api/runs/{id} and the run WebSocket).

## [3.84.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.83.1...v3.84.0) (2026-09-01)

### Features

* **routing:** the launch-frozen outcome contract — a run carries what success means ([#598](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/598)) ([1253dc4](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1253dc4b50204f236c81bbe89072e1309a81f48b)), references [#597](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/597)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    'converged + nothing blocking' has no generic representation: outputs are an opaque per-bot bag, and a consumer reading only a convergence flag would have auto-landed exactly the blocked run a measured incident came from (a converged branch carrying an explicit blocker — 190 min of downstream work reddened). Only a contract can know the fields.

## [3.83.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.83.0...v3.83.1) (2026-09-01)

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** a queued run waiting for a free runner is not an orphan ([#602](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/602)) ([a6d6fb9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a6d6fb987901c3fe9b808ca59b8b3890df243268))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The orphan sweeper reads "queued row, stale, no lease" as "the message is gone" and flips the run to failed_resumable. That is one of TWO causes with the same shape, and the other one is normal operation: a runner pod takes ONE run at a time, so a frozen pool is a hard parallelism ceiling — a campaign of multi-hour runs fills every pod and short runs simply wait their turn, unfetched, lease-less, and stale.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run document that says failed_resumable and nothing else forces every outcome consumer to guess: is a redelivery in flight? did it hit its budget wall? was it an operator stop? Measured on a live campaign: a budget wall hidden behind an empty final_error (the code existed — in the run_failed EVENT, never on the document), and an external router that marked a redelivered run 'handled' while it quietly converged.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    PerformMergeCtx checked merge_status==merged then went to work: on a multi-replica server (prod runs 3) two concurrent calls both passed the check, both built a squash (different commits under the default squash strategy), and the loser — non-FF push refused — then persisted merge_status=failed over the winner's merged via a full-document ReplaceOne. Found by adversarial plan review, verified in code; the merge path is live on every repo-targeted campaign landing.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The dispatcher resumed `cancelled` runs from their checkpoint (bilan issue-triage friction 7): an operator's cancel was undone on the next tick. The status was in the auto-resume set because the dispatcher's OWN stops (stall reap, external state change, daemon shutdown) used a bare context.CancelFunc, so the engine persisted `cancelled` for them too — removing the status alone would have turned stall recovery into a permanent park.

    A sandboxed claw node with an enabled permission gate was refused outright: delegate.IOTask carried no policy, so the in-container __claw-runner would have executed bash/file_edit/write_file ungated. That blanket refusal also made a claw fallback route useless for any gated node under the shipped sandbox: auto default — e.g. feed-watch's synthesize, which cannot degrade to the OpenAI forfait when the Anthropic usage window closes.

    The conventional-changelog plugin ran with `infile: false`, so 264 releases of notes existed only on the GitHub releases page. `infile` settles the drift objection that deferred the file: release-it writes the section in `beforeRelease` and stages it with `git add . --update`, so it lands in the release commit itself and cannot diverge from the tags.

    The launch API accepted `fallback` (the operator's single run-level rescue route, ADR-087) and the local executor honoured it — but the cloud publisher dropped it at publish: no RunMessage field, no run-doc stamp, no resume replay. The route meant to rescue a run from a provider's exhausted usage window never fired precisely where runs park unattended (measured on one campaign: 72-85% of two runs' wall-clock lost to usage-window parking a declared fallback would have bypassed).

    The aggregator has parsed and cached limit.output since ADR-042, but the field stopped at fetchedSpec: nothing downstream could read a model's completion cap. Carry it through merge onto ModelCapabilities, out via ResolvedCapabilities, and into the `iterion models` table as a MAX OUT column.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A digest over 14000 chars was truncated with a notice pointing at "the run artifacts" — somewhere its chat readers cannot go. The 28 août Veille Cyber digest (14803 chars) lost its last 803 characters that way.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A repo-targeted cloud run that died (budget cap mid-delegate, failure path) left its commits only in the git-meta snapshot: the bank push was gated on runErr == nil, so the branch never reached the forge and the successor restarted from the base commit. Turning the snapshot back into a branch took a manual replay every time — measured: nine manual recoveries in three days of one campaign.

### Bug Fixes

* **feed-watch:** size the marker reserve from the marker, and refuse the queue on a truncated digest ([#576](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/576)) ([73fdf0c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/73fdf0c096831b85c4e84f64442f5a9d2b126054))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    R79a75e. MARK_RESERVE was 32 while the truncation notice the last capped part carries is 64 chars, so a ceiling-truncated digest overshot the very budget the reserve exists to respect: at limit=1200 the last message measured 1232. An operator who sets a sink's max_chars to the platform's own limit gets that POST rejected — losing precisely the notice saying the digest was cut.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Bots parameterize their model pins, reasoning effort and tunables as ${ITERION_X:-default} expansions, read from the runner pod's env — so re-tuning a bot meant a Helm values change and a rollout, while credentials, bundles, caps, roles and the sandbox image had all moved to the CLI→API→DB settings surface.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    SubmitLaunch published the operator's budget override on the wire, but SubmitResume rebuilt its RunMessage with a nil override — so the first usage-window auto-retry silently reverted the run to the workflow's own cap. Measured: a run launched with max_duration 8h, parked by a cap and resumed, died at 14407s/14400s while its doc still displayed 8h. Cloud resumes are unattended, so nothing could re-state the ask.

    The ChatGPT-forfait wire gates model availability on the codex-cli version header.

Lived on iterion#541's /billy run: plan_review 400'd with "gpt-5.6-sol requires a newer codex-cli" on every cloud attempt, with no operator-side cure since the override never crossed the boundary.

### Bug Fixes

* **modernize:** read a scalar exit_gate as one whole command ([#520](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/520)) ([7e9dad5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7e9dad56d998a10bd652344273b049e89905150e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A YAML scalar and a sequence are both legitimate contract forms for a lot's exit_gate. plan_read joined the value with "\n" unconditionally, so a bare string was iterated character by character: the verifier's first command became the single letter of the declared gate, failed with exit 127, and the lot could never converge — a red verdict manufactured by the reader, not earned by the tree.

    The [high] that motivated `ValidateShellSafeRef` in #508 does not exist. Its premise — that a bot's `PUSH_BRANCH={{vars.push_branch}} python3 -c` reaches the shell unquoted — reads the .bot SOURCE as if it were the final command line. The engine shell-escapes every ref at substitution time (resolveCommandTemplate → shellEscapeValue), so the hostile value arrives as `PUSH_BRANCH='x;id;#'`. Proven by execution, with the shell itself as the oracle.

    The bank pushed with the claim-time token injected into the URL.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A cloud launch's model_overrides were persisted display-only: the studio showed the operator's per-node pins, but the RunMessage never carried them and the runner pod built its executor without them — every delegate ran on the workflow's own models while the Overview claimed otherwise.

    The CLI decoded /api/auth/me with a hand-mirrored struct whose flat `teams` field the server had re-nested under orgs[].teams: every field silently zeroed, so `teams switch` refused every team as 'not a member', `orgs switch` accepted only the already-active org, `orgs list` showed a single org, and `teams list` rendered an all-empty table with every row starred (wrong json tags on the same wire).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An export-based sandbox (kubernetes) hands the runner a COPY of the pod workspace. When that copy arrives stale or empty, the host clone reads exactly like a run that made no commits, and bankRepoWorkspace concluded 'nothing to bank' — a silent total loss of a finished run's work (run 01a02a4b: gate converged citing its commit hashes, FinalBranch empty, zero commits recorded).

    Adversarial review of the banking invariant found a reproducible false refusal: tar cannot delete, so when a pod-side `git gc` / `pack-refs --all --prune` moves a ref into packed-refs, the export overlay leaves the host's pre-run LOOSE ref in place — and git resolves loose before packed, so the exported clone reads a pre-run HEAD while every object actually arrived. The guard then refuses work that is sitting right there (and before the guard existed, this exact shape was a SILENT loss — it…

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** the CLI's no-credential render is an auth failure, not an answer ([e7a721e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e7a721e5e4d382cdaa276b9f614d8c37942abe9d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The credential a tenant-less run inherits — historically the runner pod's env (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from the iterion-forfait k8s secret, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY et al.) — can now live sealed in Mongo, managed by super-admins and rotated with one call that every new launch AND resume picks up (SubmitResume re-resolves credentials). The env stays as the final backstop: an empty platform store keeps today's behaviour byte-identical.

## [3.51.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.50.2...v3.51.0) (2026-08-20)

### Features

* **golden-master:** standard 3 — the net states its FEATURES, not only its routes ([7b04458](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7b04458ce937c58bf306cb1a0a36774494e7cd01))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A route the corpus touches once is not a feature it exercises. A net declaring standard 3 must ship a feature_probe (two independent witnesses: the served navigation graph and the tree's own catalogues) and a committed feature-coverage.json mapping every feature to corpus entries or excluding it in writing. The gate refuses unmapped, stale and broken-evidence inventories by name; existing nets keep their declared standard, and the verdict carries the figure so a below-standard net is visible,…

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the seal opt-in becomes committable — config.json's seal_committed, auditable like the rest ([d8ee9ef](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d8ee9ef72d7ef563fb7bf54451d7463ed2d55ec3))
* **modernize:** defect disposition — fixed and recorded by default, preserved only by written business decision ([8af1388](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8af13882835620afb2613ed50b82bf964ae2dd37))
* **modernize:** outcomes — what the programme owes becomes a conjunction term of its convergence ([f0e5332](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f0e53329ea66662cd50339aece73f867ad72fa61))
* **observability:** opt-in Sentry tracing — API transactions + LLM-call spans (Obsy dogfood) ([#463](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/463)) ([39ebe8a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/39ebe8aa7adc8845d22a9f23bf5b04cec130fcbe))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Tracing rides the SAME client and DSN as error tracking; sentry-go does not read SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE on its own, so Init resolves it and sets EnableTracing/TracesSampleRate. Unset, 0, unparsable or out of [0,1] ⇒ strictly off even with a DSN — and the refusal is loud, but never costs error tracking. NaN is rejected explicitly: it fails every ordered comparison, so the naive range check would let it through.

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master,modernize:** the adversarial review's findings — a ratchet for the standard, named refusals everywhere, and skills that say exactly what is checked ([a6d5b8f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a6d5b8f46589e50c79b8d77057de4fb7f3eb4f46))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    H2: standard-mark makes a silent 3->2 downgrade a named refusal in both drift directions. M2/M3: malformed feature-coverage and mistyped seal opt-ins bail with their cause instead of a traceback or a silence. M1: holdout_awaiting_gate is a report field, not only a notice. H1/C1/B2: the skills now state exactly what the harness checks (union-level source labels), where the outcomes conjunction is enforced today (the campaign runner, not this graph — roadmap named), and that SSR stacks DO expose…

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a gate never seals a COMMITTED held-out set — it awaits its own gate ([26bd79a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/26bd79a0798b6b0e953052a73492798158da0166))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The seal moves the set out of the tree, which strips TRACKED files when the set was committed by an earlier authoring run: the finalize then refuses the dirty tree, and the set's single scoring burns on a gate that does not own it. A committed set is now left in place and noted; the convergence gate that owns it opts in explicitly with GM_SEAL_COMMITTED=1 — a flag that can only widen what the gate consumes, never soften a verdict. Selftest 45 -> 48.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** round-2 adversarial findings — every refusal named, in every type ([703cd81](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/703cd8183348267aaed385ee5591d2646f57ed9d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Non-string reasons and feature ids, unreadable standard-marks, mistyped GM_SEAL_COMMITTED spellings, valid-JSON-non-object ledger blocks: each was a traceback or a silence, each is now a named refusal. A feature mapped twice or both mapped and excluded refuses (nobody chose). A mid-path ** in a route pattern refuses (the doctrine says a tail). The standard-raise doctrine now states the PAIRED-commit rule the code enforces. Selftest 57 -> 66.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** round-3 findings — the refusal envelope survives every path ([b99964f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b99964fad5e6d251c39827d47792099ab3756097))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A ledger block that is a dict without a string id escalates as UNPARSEABLE instead of a KeyError two functions later; the seal opt-in refusal reaches the supervisor through bail()'s JSON envelope like every other refusal; a feature excluded twice refuses (two reasons, nobody chose). No false-green found this round. Selftest 66 -> 68.

    </details>
* **modernize:** the boolean-attribute probe becomes mechanical — rendered DOM, anchors included ([4ad6952](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4ad6952197ea02b005f415561090c7c7933462fc))
* **modernize:** the judge's INPUTS are immutable too — a corpus can be amputated in silence ([fb4a453](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fb4a453d5b089fbe902df26c21a8cb19b72336e5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Narrowing corpus.json, or widening the coverage exclusions, shrinks what the net measures without moving one reference — and a green cannot report that shrinkage. The immutability check now covers what decides the verdict in all three families: the references compared, the machinery comparing them, and the inputs saying what to measure. Paths are quoted.

    </details>
* **modernize:** the judge's own machinery is as immutable as its references ([9f6ed9a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9f6ed9ac861504f59d643572c6fea68c5a50471e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A lot that rewrites verify-oracle.sh or harness.py makes every later gate answer green without measuring anything, and no reference moves — measured as a real gap. refs_untouched now diffs the runner, the harness and the canonicaliser alongside refs/.

    After a reboot, sweepStaleLocalClaimsAtBoot frees the claim that parked a card whose last run sits on a human node, and resumableRunID excludes paused_waiting_human by design — so the next tick minted a fresh run from the workflow entry, silently superseding the paused one.

    The api-keys store derives tenant_id from the context — on write it stamps the row, on read it filters — and requireAuth stamps the CALLER'S ACTIVE team.

    Two devbox.json files can supply a run's binaries — the bot's own and the target repo's — and until now both installed, always.

A review reads a diff and writes comments; it built nothing, and it paid iterion's own 319 Nix paths, 406 MiB downloaded, 1.8 GiB unpacked, a desktop GUI stack included, before its first node.

    An empty queue makes a digest exit at plan -> load_pending -> done: no LLM, no post, status finished.

    Setup runs on the same ctx the node loop does, so the same two interruptions reach it: a runner drained mid-rollout, and an operator cancelling.

    A digest drains a QUEUE, not a day. That distinction is invisible until something interrupts the run: a shut usage window, a paused schedule, a feed that came back. Then the queue holds five days of material and the digest presents it as this morning's news — dated today, ranked as breaking.

    A subscription meters two rolling windows and refuses every call once one is exhausted. iterion already survived that refusal — the run parks and a durable retry resumes it when the window reopens.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `worktree: auto` run that succeeds removes its checkout; one that fails or is interrupted leaves it behind for inspection and never comes back for it. On a long-lived store that pool is where the disk goes, and `runs prune` cannot reach it — its own doc says it never touches worktrees/.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two sources of end-of-run dirt, each of which forced a human landing: the harness self-copy now materialises ONE canonical form and writes only on change (no more header churn between the standalone and the inlined node), and emit_runner commits its own emissions — runner, report, harness, a bytecode-cache gitignore — scoped to the oracle dir. A landed-by-hand net is where a hardened runner got clobbered once.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Four requests sat unacted behind four consecutive green convergences: each one quarantines known-diverging entries out of the verdict, so the gate was green AROUND a narrowing net — the failure this bot exists to catch, one level up. Pending requests are now a conjunction term, parsed from the ledger's machine blocks; supersedence becomes the declared 'replaces' field (prose does not count), and an unparseable block is an escalation, never a guess. Selftest 32 -> 38.

* **clean:** a bare repo is still a repo, and a photograph is not the present ([c6f610f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c6f610f0e46c1284d50300291bd1f1ad79361454))

    Third adversarial pass, aimed at what the second one rewrote — which is where it found most of what follows.

* **clean:** a guard buried in `err == nil` is a guard that disappears ([3404f19](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3404f19ddf702d04763e235a53120ec6ff80e409))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Fifth pass. It overturns one of the fourth's fixes, which is the honest outcome: what round 4 removed as a false positive was the only thing standing between a self-contained clone and its own destruction.

* **clean:** git answers in absolute paths, and a store dir need not ([ec3f9cb](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ec3f9cb5c7fe94c9a9aeaaf9735cd1d83dcd0da7))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Seventh pass. Six rounds had been finding regressions of the round before; this one found something that had been there since the first commit and that every guard added since silently depends on.

* **clean:** git must be talking about THIS directory, and merged must mean built upon ([2c0050a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2c0050a882a8f966632c4c6c01bce72fb85bbe45))

    An adversarial pass broke the first cut in ways that destroyed work at the default level. Each of these was reproduced before it was fixed.

    Fourth and last adversarial pass, aimed at what the third one wrote.

    </details>
* **clean:** take the run's lock, and stop calling "we could not tell" a leftover ([9e53b63](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9e53b638aa3996259c6a081c3fb6ab267ca66fa5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Second adversarial pass. The first one's fixes were right and incomplete: what it left open destroyed work, and what it over-refused made the command nearly useless.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the emitted runner keeps the log out of the verdict it re-reads ([61324fe](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/61324feb6082d225eb0ad0496e83951a56fc680a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The template piped the harness's stderr into the JSON report, so the runner died parsing its own progress messages — a campaign found it, hardened its materialised copy, and the next emission reintroduced the defect from this template. Fixed where it is emitted from.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Five required corpus probes — a creation, the error-then-corrected journey, a case pair, a text sort, a login case variant — enforced mechanically before boot, exactly like the mutant archetypes: a tag without its shape does not count. A routes_probe + route-coverage gate names every route the corpus never touches, unless its exclusion carries a written reason. Write entries gain multi-step journeys in one session. The write surface gains a create_lost archetype. Fixture doctrine: seeded id…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A major redefines semantics under unchanged lines: routing edge forms, implicit binding conversion, query strictness, template attribute semantics, dialect functions, seed allocator state, collation, and defaults that flip silently. The upgrade-archetypes skill carries the eight classes as data; each is instantiated from the migration notes of the exact major crossed, probed mechanically, and recorded in the tree. The plan contract gains crosses_major, and the sweep record is checked by the…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The sealed pile lived beside the workspace, which assumes a writable parent — a sandboxed run mounts the worktree's parent read-only and the first seal died on it. The default root is now the system temp dir, and the name hashes the absolute workspace path: sibling worktrees of one repo share a basename, and under a common root they would otherwise seal into each other's pile. GM_SEALED_DIR and GM_SCRATCH still override.

* **pipelines:** stop leaking review-scope banners when stepping turns ([#427](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/427)) ([b80ed51](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b80ed513cf3a87bfb2b5e1a9d84fd7e8b365189e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ReviewScopePanel and HumanPromptForm shared the same React key as siblings. React's remaining-children map keeps only the last child per key, so Prev/Next unmounted the form and left every previous ReviewScopePanel mounted. A card with dozens of human gates then stacked "No file diff for this review" once per visit.

    Acci's own bilan records the failure this bot exists to remove. On run 019f3d3b-7aea the RGAA review found four real defects, emitted them without the `status` field the gates count by, and the report published "0 non conformes" — four true findings erased between the agent and the deliverable. The gates were right. The DETECTOR was a language model, so a dropped field was indistinguishable from a clean repo, and the fix that day (count a status-less finding as NC) is damage control around the…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Observed on iterion#386 today: a 20-minute verify ended the RUN, not the build. TimeoutExpired was caught and then the handler itself raised — e.output is bytes on the timeout path even though text=True was passed, because the decode happens after communicate() returns normally and a timeout attaches the raw buffer instead. bytes + str is a TypeError, so the operator got failed_resumable and a traceback where a verdict belonged.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    GitLab's AdminClient gains ListCommitStatuses (the CommitStatusLister capability), the read half of the merge gate: without it the gate reconciler must abstain on GitLab — a review that dies leaves the required context absent forever — and the auto-fix lane can never launch, since it refuses to act on a gate it cannot see. GitLab returns every status row on a commit (retries included), so the result keeps only the newest row per name; a gate reader handed raw history could match a stale verdict…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Three holds on 2026-08-12 reported "build/tests not green" over an excerpt containing nothing but a list of ok lines and a bare FAIL. The report carried out[-4000:], and a test runner prints its per-package successes after the package that failed — so the blind tail is systematically the wrong excerpt. It now carries the matched failing lines too.

### Bug Fixes

* **expr:** concat() is the array builtin — string joins use +, and a guard now says so ([8125c06](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8125c0660f3bc7fd3abf9d368efd5a659dff9303))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A compute expression written concat('prefix: ', outputs.x.log) parses, compiles and validates clean, then dies at evaluation with "want array". It lives in notice/fail_log fields inside if(converged, …, <the concat>) — the FAILURE branch — so it crashes only once something else has already gone wrong, turning a reported failure into a dead run. It had shipped in a bundled subbot's refusal path; a sibling bot hit the same shape on its first real run and exposed the class.

    </details>
* **review-env:** an attached skill is a FILE, not a registry entry ([82b8eff](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/82b8efffba96580dece24df0f9c63afe2cb2073f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    First real run: the plugin mirrored deploy-target.md into the workspace's .claude/skills/, the agent asked the Skill tool for it by name, got "Unknown skill" — that registry carries the bundle's own skills — and correctly refused to deploy. The refusal worked; the premise was wrong. The prompt now names the mirrored PATH as the authority (the pattern app-dev's validated deploy phase already used) and says a missing registry entry is not evidence of a missing skill.

    </details>
* **review-env:** the cluster is the authority on pullability, not an anonymous probe ([e14360c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e14360c211e767f1213e0b979396a4789845534c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two runs refused to deploy a NAMED image because a probe of the private registry answered 401 — a probe the agent was never meant to run: the pull credential lives in the namespace as an operator-provisioned imagePullSecret it cannot read, by design. So it predicted the failure instead of measuring it, and left the only question that matters unanswered. The prompt now says: once you can name the image, apply and let the rollout answer; ImagePullBackOff is a measurement you report.

    </details>
* **review-env:** the mounted path is the rendered template, not the env var ([e18e9bc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e18e9bc618ba5d7ac36f4e39b60232ac81211406))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on the first deploying run: a secret's env: declaration is injected into TOOL nodes (executor_tool, verified actions), not into a delegated agent's shell — $DEPLOY_CREDENTIAL was unset and the agent had to recover the path from the task header. The prompt now gives {{secrets.deploy_credential}} as the reliable path and says the unset env var is expected, not evidence of a missing credential.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Deploys the workspace's already-CI-published image to the operator-attached platform and hands back a live https URL — realism for end-to-end tests, captures and review that localhost cannot give. The platform lives ENTIRELY in the attached deploy-target skill (one plugin enabled per instance; swapping infrastructure = swapping the plugin + the deploy_credential secret, never the bot), the credential is used strictly by reference, the image is the repo's own CI's, and the URL verdict is…

### Features

* **campaign:** a deterministic supervisor carries a whole programme, lot after lot ([e693a02](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e693a025cbe3a1144ee179821a5f6e2e80b9b00b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    modernize takes ONE lot per run by design; the programme is a suite of runs, and someone has to be the suite. That someone was a human first: a full modernisation programme was replayed end to end under manual supervision and the interventions were counted — nearly all mechanical, and the acceptance criterion held on every re-record act (observed diff == announced set, every time). This bot mechanises exactly what was mechanical and routes the rest to a human.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the ledger speaks a machine-readable protocol — request, act, verdict ([6eee2c2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6eee2c22034b59e74be3702897b348d78c381a54))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A worker that may not re-record announces; the party that owns the net answers. Three HTML-comment blocks in REBASELINE.md carry the protocol so a supervising process can execute the separation of powers mechanically: a request names its lot, its cause and the EXACT expected paths; an act is written only when the observed diff equals that announcement; a verdict only when the full counter-test replayed green on the committed tree.

### Bug Fixes

* **campaign:** bool/json inputs render as JSON literals — name the atoms ([1545155](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/15451551a783579a2a75e5e3818970a90fecb7f1))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    {{input.moved}} arrives in a python script as the token 'false', and any json field can carry true/false/null inside. Found by the bot's second real run: the steward crashed on NameError. One line gives the three JSON atoms their Python names before interpolation.

    </details>
* **campaign:** the engine's materialised node script is not work in flight ([15ab7b0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/15ab7b0b017c6bb9d3205e5bdb7d808fb3c8678c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Every script tool sees its own .iterion-script-*.py in the workspace for the lifetime of the node (executor_tool materialises it there), so the supervisor's clean-tree refusal fired on every run, and the steward would have counted it in every observed diff. Found by the bot's first real run: preflight refused a freshly created worktree. Excluded from all three status reads — it is execution machinery, never part of a verdict.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The run-level override stopped at the launch boundary: a cloud pod re-resolved the guard from the workflow and its own empty environment, so `--loop-budget-guard off` on a bot that declares nothing ran guarded anyway, and `on` against a bot declaring `off` could still strand its work at the cap. An operator's explicit choice, quietly re-made elsewhere — the failure `auto_memory` closed at schema v6.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `commit_check` decided between the `committed` and `clean` verdicts from the shas alone. An unmoved head has two causes, though, and they are opposite verdicts: the bump genuinely needed no alignment, or `align` produced one that never reached the branch. Both are green under the old wiring, and `clean` is what the required check reports.

* **runner:** a weekly cap parked four reviews with nothing coming back ([#389](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/389)) ([c710817](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c710817436f5af594e3302539c0f2ae2679c7c50))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    usageWindowRetryAt documents three evidence sources for "the provider's window is shut": the typed error, a classified runtime code, "and the flattened message is a last resort for a host that has neither — which is not hypothetical, since a runner with no dispatcher wired classifies nothing at all." The third one was never implemented. usageWindowEvidence returned false unless a type or a code survived, so on any host where neither does, the provider's own words — sitting right there in…

### Bug Fixes

* **gate:** a review in flight is indistinguishable from one that never ran ([#387](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/387)) ([da6afa1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/da6afa1e73bb1db59ff38ce48591909eb5801eca)), references [buildkit-operator#19](https://github.com/buildkit-operator/issues/19)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The merge gate only ever posted a verdict, at the END of a run that takes minutes. For that whole window the required context carries NO status, which a forge renders as "Expected — waiting for status to be reported" — byte-identical to a review that was never launched. Read next to the reviewer's comment on the previous commit, it looks exactly like "the bot commented but the gate never went green". Reported from production on buildkit-operator#19 today.

    </details>
* **modernize:** a blocked lot was re-attempted on every run, forever ([98324c9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/98324c9d010739764653d95c46fc8905ff2e842a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on a replay campaign: a lot declared itself blocked after forty-two minutes — the toolchain raise it carried changes observable behaviour, and it said so in a committed report rather than force its gate green. The NEXT run picked the same lot again, redid the same work, and hit the same wall. In a single-run workflow that is harmless, since a human reads the report and decides. In a loop it wedges, and it burns the budget doing it.

    </details>

## [3.35.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.34.2...v3.35.0) (2026-08-10)

### Features

* **golden-master:** a write surface, and two archetypes that were required nowhere ([3cd5a6e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3cd5a6ed293767ba850f17f35e255058e6d26f71))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The net only ever read. A corruption applied when content is STORED — a tag lost, an attribute normalised, an identifier drawn afresh on every save — moved no reference and passed the gate green, so proving it took a script outside the net. That is where such proofs end up when the net cannot write.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the report names which mutants could no longer be applied ([a994d8c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a994d8c1f7752b266c34fcd8ff02a4b10d8f80ec))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    They were already said, in free text, in the middle of the log. A mutant goes invalid for two very different reasons — it mutates nothing, so it never proved anything; or its anchor vanished under a legitimate change, so it DID prove something and has stopped. Only the second is mechanically repairable, and telling them apart means reading a field rather than matching a phrase.

    </details>
* **modernize:** repair a mutant the lot invalidated, by delegating to the net's own bot ([2e682d2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2e682d22b1ab0addb8753111eb3b0fb6896ca14a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A modernisation lot is entitled to rename a method or restructure a template. When it does, a mutant that patched the old form stops patching anything. The harness calls it INVALID, correctly, and the surface it probed stops being covered — while NOTHING goes red, because an invalid mutant is excluded from the score and the figure looks no worse. A lot can go green while the net gets narrower, which is the one failure a green cannot report.

    </details>
* **modernize:** surface which mutants the oracle could no longer apply ([383bf9a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/383bf9a3a0c707adceaa5f9962d1799a4082902f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A lot may legitimately remove the thing a mutant hooks into — a security major withdraws the matcher idiom one named, a front-end major replaces the configuration block another edited. The patch stops applying, the harness marks the mutant invalid, and an invalid mutant neither scores nor dilutes: it simply stops proving anything, quietly, on whichever lane it covered. The gate can stay green while the counter-test that made that lane worth trusting has gone dark.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** collateral blamed the mutant without ever testing a third cause ([9ee97e8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9ee97e88d530b176afb3b97ca885016e2b0e9255))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A control entry that differs from its reference was attributed to the mutant, and the message offered exactly two explanations: an under-declared blast radius, or a capture that is not isolated. There is a third, and it is the only one in which the mutant plays no part — THE CONTROL ENTRY DOES NOT REPRODUCE ITSELF. Whichever mutant happened to sample it wears the blame.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the two copies of the harness had drifted, and the test said otherwise ([c19926e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c19926e17e39162b28690189a4fe90ca56c6556a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The harness exists twice: inlined in main.bot's oracle_run node, which is the copy that runs, and as oracle-harness.py, which is the copy a human reads. A test claimed to keep them in sync. It pinned the set of top-level function names and the report fields, on the stated grounds that verbatim comparison was impossible.

    </details>
* **runview:** reset dropped nodes' execution state on run_rewound ([#382](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/382)) ([353c0c2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/353c0c28567b4d34a66b312ee230d2932e936ec5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A rewind invalidates the dropped nodes' checkpoint outputs, but the snapshot the studio renders node colours and infos from is folded from the append-only event log — and none of the three reducers handled the run_rewound event Rewind appends. The pre-rewind node_started / node_finished records kept folding in, so rewound nodes stayed painted with their pre-rewind status, duration and error instead of resetting to never-run.

    </details>

## [3.34.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.34.1...v3.34.2) (2026-08-09)

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a reference carrying a carriage return never reproduced itself ([ab9c83c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ab9c83c720a98916c00bb56d3b4c71cb6816c3a0))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The harness wrote references without a newline setting and read them back without one either. On Linux the write default translates nothing and lets carriage returns reach the disk; the read default enables universal newlines and turns them into line feeds. From the moment such a reference is recorded it differs from what the capture produces — permanently, with no code having moved.

### Features

* **improve-loops:** the ratchet — name it, and ask for it before the report ([37644da](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/37644dac977e77c986e4cde5039b610b57f12847))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The asymptote says why a run stops. Nothing said why the next run does not re-earn what this one banked, though the machinery for it ships everywhere: a gate reading a real exit code, a commit landed per verified unit, a diagnostic that makes a defect class impossible to repeat, a bilan that outlives the run. docs/improvement-ratchet.md gives those parts one name and one image each, and states the divergence from the family of ideas everyone will recognise: continuous improvement is unending,…

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **rewind:** scope the workspace restore to what the run recorded changing ([#381](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/381)) ([4e29c0a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4e29c0adb0c9205929aad6552bfefb287119f7e6)), closes [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380), references [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380) [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380) [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion rewind` forced the ENTIRE workspace back to the pivot's snapshot. On the default run shape — no `worktree: auto` — that workspace is the operator's live checkout, so one rewind reverted 38 tracked files and deleted 2 that no node of the run had ever written (#380).

### Features

* **golden-master:** a canvas lane, and the browser plumbing it shares ([276ee97](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/276ee97b3c64996ed0319464ed4713a3b59094e8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A canvas is the one surface nothing else can observe: the served document carries an empty tag, and the DOM stops changing once the image is painted. An accessibility audit says so itself — a datum rendered only as colour or as canvas is not restituted. A chart that stopped drawing entirely would leave every reference in a repository identical to the byte.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** keep DSL-fail runs rewindable by preserving the checkpoint ([#376](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/376)) ([5f56229](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5f56229ad79e19b8a4bb478b478752cadf820d56)), closes [#373](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/373)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run that reaches the DSL fail node was definitively unrecoverable: the fail path wrote status failed without a checkpoint, and the status transition purged the one that existed, so neither resume, rewind, nor cancel could bring the run back to a rewindable state — even though the on-disk state was coherent and the workspace snapshots survived.

    </details>
* **runview:** let a fork replace its dead parent on the pipeline board ([#377](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/377)) ([e4c17c7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e4c17c748e7c42a2a88dc56e16c37adf5db635e3)), closes [#374](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/374)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run launched from a board card and recovered via fork disappeared from its card for good: the card kept showing the dead parent with no way to detach it, while the fork — the operator's actual recovery — ran invisibly. Since fork is the only way to recover a terminal run, recovery came at the price of board tracking.

    </details>
* **runview:** stop the skip-run and finalize log loops ([#378](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/378)) ([a8e3c11](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a8e3c110d14fba756b88e5dbc681637e0dd5b39e)), closes [#375](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/375)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Run ids whose run.json was gone stayed listed by the store and were reloaded on every UI poll, each producing a WARN line — several lines per second, indefinitely, drowning the instance log (50 MB of noise on an active instance). Same family: the finalize recovery re-warned 'cannot read worktree HEAD' every minute on deleted worktrees.

## [3.32.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.31.1...v3.32.0) (2026-08-07)

### Features

* cross-backend model fallback chain (`fallbacks:`) ([#365](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/365)) ([38d4f07](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/38d4f0761016b8087c2420be71d83c7fcc48f057)), references [#1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Discharges the cross-API deferral ADR-004 recorded in its Decision (5) and Alternative #1, and records why the obvious generalisation (flip providerFallbackEligible) is unsafe: a backend swap re-shapes seven delegate.Task fields, three pre-run analyses read a single static backend name, and both the run-level usage-window retry and the credential-pool donor cooldown key on the terminal error's type.

* **e2e-coverage:** Endy — matrix-anchored e2e coverage completion bot ([f3de156](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f3de1569feea7f8a9a49ad04eeda53f5ad5881f9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ADR-058 v2 shape (one campaign + deterministic gate + bounded continuation), specialized for FEATURE-level e2e completeness: a committed feature×coverage matrix is the inventory, the living todo, the done-oracle and the audit trail. The verify_run gate enforces the matrix contract deterministically — parse, allowed statuses, justified exceptions, and a claims check where every covered-* row must cite a test that resolves in the tree (an orphan claim is a red gate). new_test_code is…

### Bug Fixes

* **cli+e2e:** two round-2 test findings — a base64 blind spot and a 210s detection ([c0d3080](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c0d3080421d5f1e24863dec8381e16d16f1aee04))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The secret round-trip claimed 'no plaintext on disk' but grepped only the raw bytes; the sealed field is a []byte, which json writes as base64, so a Seal/Open pass-through mutation (no encryption at all) survived the assertion. It now greps the base64 forms too — measured: the mutation that survived is killed, naming the store file.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** close eight false-green bypasses in the matrix gate ([7dcf452](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7dcf452695b72860f8be92a56a879ce93080ed3c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial review executed seven distinct ways to make the gate say matrix_ok=true on a matrix that proves nothing, counts less than it claims, or is not even the table the operator reads:

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** inventory the nine surfaces the audit found missing ([c5521d5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c5521d527bfc5bee03e29a91f0a212edbc365bc9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The matrix claimed completeness while nine operator-observable surfaces had no row at all — an omission is exactly what the inventory promise forbids. Six were already covered and only needed citing (bots install core, `bots templates`, plugin lifecycle run, /api/v1/pipeline-board, /api/v1/limits/cost, /api/backends/detect); three are real gaps now visible: `iterion server` and `iterion runner` CLI boot, and /api/effort-capabilities (reached today only as a readiness probe that asserts nothing…

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** repair eleven more mis-citations found by the second audit ([9ecb92b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9ecb92be2fd1d11e417551b30988aa1be223d260))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A second adversarial pass sampled 40 fresh rows (70 across both audits) and found the same failure mode as the first: a row cites the mechanics of a helper while the WIRING that invokes it goes untested.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** repair four façade citations found by the matrix audit ([dc7d422](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/dc7d42263fc69e89b4c7f32e344fc860cb559f5f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial audit sampled 30 covered rows and found four whose cited test would pass while the promised feature is broken:

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** round-2 gate hardening — a false POSITIVE and six more bypasses ([83e588d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/83e588d5e6fe9d10aa9d14d9a731cda4a2a75a69))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The round-1 hardening was itself reviewed adversarially. The worst finding is a false positive, which in a blocking gate costs as much as a hole: the test-file regex required a slash on BOTH sides of tests/ and spec/, so a ROOT-level tests/ (Rust, pytest), spec/ (RSpec) or __tests__/ (Jest) was rejected — this gate would have refused the legitimate matrix of most non-Go repos and could never converge there.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** round-3 — the round-2 hardening had narrowed the gate to Go ([2e8d7a7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2e8d7a784afc5d6b0dc8849b5ac45346b0146a9c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Round 2 fixed a false positive and introduced two more, in the same place: the gate had quietly narrowed to matrices whose citations look like Go test function names — which is this repo's shape and almost nobody else's.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** verify.sh must be overwritten and workspace-relative ([0af0da7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0af0da7b847e570cfcc917d0af2d694da7938c61))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The scratch dir is per-project, shared across runs: V3's verify_build found V1's script pinned to a dead worktree path. The prompt now mandates overwrite + $PWD-relative commands (the gate already runs the script with the repo root as cwd).

    </details>
* **e2e:** two live fixtures died on a cd into an unexpanded variable ([3c822d1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3c822d15eccc8d26b3118c84fea951b5a8eaaa42))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    feat_worktree.bot and feat_compress.bot both opened their tool command with cd "${PROJECT_DIR}". That placeholder is only expanded in a bot var DEFAULT, never inside a command, so the shell got cd "" and the node failed before doing anything — TestLive_Feat_Worktree and TestLive_Feat_Compress could never pass, whatever the feature did.

    </details>
* **queue:** a message from a newer server is transient, not malformed ([ca2ef58](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ca2ef588e1ffcf730951584aab5a3a96f048f3cf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A runner that could not decode a delivery Termed it, whatever the reason. For a malformed payload that is right — no consumer will ever decode it. For a payload from a NEWER server it destroys a run: the queue entry is gone while the run document stays `queued` forever, and the only trace is one line in one pod's log. Nothing surfaces to the operator, who sees a run stuck in "queued" with no explanation.

    </details>
* **runtime:** a structured LLM call now anchors a turn, like a text one ([5d162d8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5d162d871e27c6f389946cc19c08d18af123c358))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Turn capture lived only in GenerateTextDirect. Every node declaring an output: schema — which in iterion is most of them — runs through GenerateObjectDirect and so anchored NOTHING: no TurnCheckpoint, an empty per-node timeline, and `iterion fork` failing with "turn not found" on a run that had plainly executed. The Fork API and the timeline were effectively blind to the majority of claw nodes.

    </details>
* **studio:** a workflow with no LLM nodes no longer crashes the Launch view ([457374d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/457374dddc6b849acf17a36f1c5213c6f8e0aedd))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    POST /api/runs/preview-cost answers {"nodes": null} for a workflow with no agent/judge node, and CostPreviewChip dereferenced data.nodes.length — the whole Launch view fell into its error boundary, so a tool+compute-only bot could not be launched from the studio at all. Found by the new studio UI Playwright suite (V4 dogfood, run 019fd6e6); the KNOWN-BUG tripwire test now asserts the positive contract instead.

    </details>
* **test:** detect nested checkouts by their .git, not by directory name ([bbe2dd9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/bbe2dd9de0fefb2af29f19cd7b1b94df30634731))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous fix hardcoded .claude and .works — one is this harness deal, the other is a purely local convention of one operator. Where someone parks their worktrees and sibling clones is not this repo business.

    </details>
* **test:** the bot-identity audit walked into the operator nested checkouts ([8c42f09](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8c42f098cc62701bb403b716af9cf90b11d29c64))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    TestEveryExecutorConstructionDecidesTheBotIdentity walks the tree to find executor constructions that skip the bot identity, but its skip list did not cover .claude/worktrees or .works — git worktrees and sibling repos an operator keeps on disk. None of their files are tracked here, and their older copies report as offenders of a rule they predate, so the test passed inside a worktree and failed in the main checkout.

## [3.31.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.31.0...v3.31.1) (2026-08-05)

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** iterion's own scaffolding kept converged runs from landing ([597b066](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/597b066eaeb30cdecb356c0d1dddcc6ad4f55617))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    At run start iterion mirrors the bundle's skills into the worktree under `.claude/skills/`. Finalize then read those untracked files as "the bot left work uncommitted", banked them as a wip commit — and a wip-banked HEAD is never merged, by design. The result: a run whose gate CONVERGED did not land, and the only thing standing in the way was iterion's own scaffolding.

    </details>

## [3.31.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.30.13...v3.31.0) (2026-08-05)

### Features

* **dsl:** add auto_memory: — a per-node MEMORY.md switch, off by default ([0283edc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0283edc8a1cc9d8dd0af6533f13e2ec26aca5a15))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Auto-memory behaved differently on each backend, silently, and no .bot author could control it: claude_code's own default is ON, so every node of every run read and wrote the operator's personal ~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/, while claw and pi had no MEMORY.md at all. On a cloud pod, anything written to a pod-local directory died with the run.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a run launched from a linked worktree described another branch ([ca72827](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ca728277cc4c2deb55007f1eb0e4262e89be2465))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion run` resolves the repo root up to the MAIN repository — that is where .git lives and where worktrees are registered, and it is correct. It then read `HEAD` there too, which is not: a linked worktree has its own HEAD and its own branch, and the run silently anchored on whatever the main checkout happened to be on.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** host_state=none dropped the git identity along with the mount ([365c048](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/365c0482ea2fd98651cb05654178496c869d299c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Under host_state: auto the operator's ~/.gitconfig is bind-mounted, and that mount is what gives an in-sandbox `git commit` an author. Turning host state off — the documented setting for multi-tenant and cloud runners — removed the mount and, with it, the identity: every commit-producing bot then dies on "Author identity unknown", for a reason unrelated to what it was asked to do.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** the shipped images declare no locale, so the JVM read ASCII ([0223a9e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0223a9e49caa959668bbfcce0d83bb71f75a56d1))

    Measured on the slim image: `LANG` and `LC_ALL` are both empty. That is not a neutral state — it IS the C/POSIX locale, and a JVM derives `sun.jnu.encoding` from it and decodes filenames as ASCII. A build whose resources carry an accented name fails on "Problems opening file input stream", naming a file that is plainly on disk. An agent working in the sandbox has to discover this and prefix its own commands to get past it.

* **dep-update-guard:** the drift-gate precheck loops back instead of discarding the run ([#370](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/370)) ([722bacf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/722bacfee3cf53193154a9e7ba2a9b5c8308c56c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Twice in one day the aligner's correct Vite 8 migration was thrown away because verify.sh omitted the repo's CI drift gate and the deterministic precheck fired at VERDICT time (rc=3 → hold_unstable, alignment discarded). The omission is an authorship defect, not a red build: the agent scopes 'bump-relevant' and rationalises away repo-wide gates (a studio bump 'cannot drift' the Go openapi — but §1b gates are never scoped out).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    EstimateUSD consults claw's LIVE pricing registry first, so the price tests' expectations depended on whatever the network returned that day — flaky on the host, and reliably wrong inside sandbox pods, where this failure has now twice painted a Vetty verify red on an otherwise CI-green PR (#19's Vite 8 alignment being the second). Pin the tests to the fallback path via CLAW_DISABLE_LIVE_REGISTRY=1 except where the live-cache behaviour is itself under test (seeded explicitly).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git status --porcelain` writes `XY <path>`, and X is a space for an unstaged modification. Stripping the whole output before splitting ate that leading space on the first line only, so it shifted by one and lost a character: `build.gradle` came out as `uild.gradle`. Later lines were intact.

    A run completed with Status FINISHED having executed no lot at all. The plan reader could not find yq, emitted nothing_to_do, and the graph routed straight to done. Every failure path in that reader called the same emit(), which exits 0 — so three very different outcomes collapsed into one benign one:

    A bundle or a repo could declare devbox packages and get NONE of them, with the run continuing as if they were there. Three causes, each measured on a real run rather than reasoned about, and each fixed where it belongs.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Narrowing which freshly-applied issue label dispatches the implementer (`label_allowlist`) was a webhook-config PATCH, and Provision rebuilds that config as a whole literal from the manifests. Any bot-set change — the studio Integrations tab PATCHes bot_ids and nothing else — therefore dropped the narrowing, silently and fail-OPEN: an empty allowlist matches every label, so the repo returned to starting a feature-dev campaign on any label added to any issue.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    cost.Annotate received task.Model — the node-declared model, empty on every node that relies on backend auto-detection — so EstimateUSD priced against an unknown model, emitted no _cost_usd, and the whole run reported tokens but no cost (the studio report then shows its 'no cost recorded' placeholder forever; observed on the feed-watch cloud runs, where system/init resolved claude-opus-5 but the node declares no model).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Aggregator feeds (FeedBlitz, FeedBurner) serve tracking URLs whose host is the aggregator's, not the article's. The synthesize agent web_fetches those items, lands on the canonical article and naturally cites its final URL — which the deterministic verify_message gate then rejects as off-item, failing the whole digest (observed live: the java digest run 019fc65e died on two baeldung.com links served as feeds.feedblitz.com items).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    EnsureManagedSecret returned the stored managed-secret id without touching its plaintext — a ONE-HOUR GitHub App installation token minted at provision time. On a quiet connection (no provision, no worker rotation) every repo-targeted launch pinned that dead token and failed its clone with 'Invalid username or token' (observed live on prod relaunching the feed-watch java digest; the daily schedules never noticed because they resolve the team's forge_token binding instead). Re-mint at the point…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A generic engine failure Naks for redelivery, and every failed delivery fired the completion webhook + run.<outcome> event anyway — one 'run failed' notification episode per redelivery (the episode key folds updated_at precisely so a later REAL re-failure notifies again), i.e. up to MaxDeliver pushes for a single deterministic failure within a minute (observed live: feed-watch run 019fc65e re-failed 8 times in 70s on its checkpointed verify input).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run whose model could not be priced records _tokens without _cost_usd; the Report tab treated that as 'no cost yet' and showed the fills-in-as- nodes-finish placeholder forever, even on finished runs. The report now renders whenever any usage (cost OR tokens) exists: bars and rankings scale by tokens when no cost was recorded, and cost cells show an explicit '—' rather than a fake $0. Buckets tie-break by tokens so a tokens-only report still ranks meaningfully.

    </details>
* **studio:** show per-bucket cost as unavailable instead of a fake $0.00 ([2143f6a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2143f6a516968fb2fb23282f3b74a9cc3aec90f4))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In a mixed run (some nodes priced, some not) the report-level hasCost flag rendered unpriced buckets as "$0.00 / 0%" next to their real token counts, reading as "this node was free". The cost and percent cells now decide per bucket: no recorded cost renders as an explicit unavailable marker. Found by adversarial review.

    A gate previews a `file` value by fetching `GET /api/runs/{id}/attachments/{name}` — the descriptor's path is a host or sandbox bind-mount path and is not reachable from a browser (iterion#332, #336). So attachments only ever entered a run from a PERSON: the launch form, a `file`-typed gate field, the 📎 button.

    The pause tells the operator their answer is added "to the allowlist for the rest of this run". It was added to one policy, for one re-invocation, and then dropped.

* **studio:** a needs-attention lane that reserves its concurrency slot ([#344](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/344)) ([b49d74b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b49d74b542d3e1c1374bfa1e01540a6994446e8e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A pipeline that died mid-flight used to file itself under Closed and hand its concurrency slot straight to the next queued card. Closed means "this reached its end", and a crash did not — so the failure read as done, and by the time the operator fixed it the slot was gone.

## [3.21.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.20.0...v3.21.0) (2026-08-01)

### Features

* **runner:** graceful lame-duck drain of in-flight runs on deploy ([3ec777f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3ec777fa708797edb599934084975bcdd89e139c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In cloud mode a rolling deploy SIGTERMs the runner pods. Previously a gracefully-drained in-flight run was checkpointed as `cancelled`, which the redelivery reconciliation deliberately drops (anti-resurrection guard) — so the run needed a MANUAL resume and every deploy emitted a false "run cancelled" web-push. Only the crash/timeout paths auto-resumed.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **drain:** close what auto-resume re-opened ([3e3c2f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3e3c2f09df65e5e438aea4495886736c07b6b1ed))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Making an interruption auto-resume turns a rare, operator-driven recovery into a routine one, so paths that were safe because nobody took them are now taken on every scale-down. Found by an adversarial pass over the rebase.

* **gate-autofix:** the unattended launch reached Mongo with no tenant ([b68f8a3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b68f8a39fd6240e5679db6eb08ac6d5b91236e20))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The auto-fix lane stamped the auth identity the admission gate reads and not the store identity every tenant-scoped query asserts on. A bus handler is not an HTTP request and carries neither; the inbound-webhook middleware stamps both and this lane copied half of it.

    </details>
* **runner:** don't resurrect an operator cancel during a lame-duck drain ([f700b5b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f700b5b7197b556008ac02752db043c3b36218dc))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adversarial review found a HIGH regression: the shutdown-vs-operator distinction inferred "shutdown cancel" from parent.Err() (the loop ctx), which only means "a SIGTERM happened" — not "this run's cancel came from shutdown". In the default lame-duck mode the pod holds the run for up to DrainTimeout (8h), during which an operator cancel (via the iterion.cancel.<run_id> subject) would be misclassified as a shutdown interruption, promoted cancelled→failed_resumable, and auto-resumed —…

* **runtime:** route mid-node interruptions through the cause-aware handler ([b14e11c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b14e11c39bce44dabfb64184307956d66b7fcc68))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adversarial review of the cause-threading refactor found the clean handling only fired for the between-node/pre-run window (the top-of-loop select). The COMMON real case — a deploy drains a run WHILE an LLM node is executing — surfaced the cancellation as the node's execErr and routed it through failRunWithCheckpoint, which stringifies the error and loses the ErrRunInterrupted sentinel: the runner then fired a spurious "run failed" notification and stamped finalStatus=failed, even though the…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A value box that never puts its content permanently out of reach: short values render whole, long ones collapse to a preview with a "Show all N lines" toggle that expands IN PLACE. Every value carries a copy button, and a JSON value (structured, or a JSON string as bot_args carry them) gets a raw/pretty toggle.

### Bug Fixes

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `resolveMapping` never interpolated. With exactly one reference it returned that reference's value and dropped everything around it; with two or more it returned the raw template, unresolved. Only a mapping whose whole value was a single `{{…}}` came out right — which is why this survived: that is the shape almost every mapping has.

## [3.19.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.18.1...v3.19.0) (2026-08-01)

### Features

* **studio:** render a human gate's inbound payload so operators see what they are validating ([#336](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/336)) ([79d6110](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/79d611067d42d750983002a82267f0e94e2a4fae)), closes [#332](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/332), references [iterion#332](https://github.com/iterion/issues/332)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A paused gate could not show the operator WHAT they were validating. The data was already there end to end — `Engine.persistPause` resolves the node's incoming `with {}` mappings and stores them as `Interaction.Questions`, which the run console and the pipeline board both receive — but the form is driven by the node's OUTPUT schema, so the inbound half reached the browser and was dropped on the floor. Authors worked around it by stringifying the plan/diff/verdict into `instructions:`; anyone…

### Bug Fixes

* **e2e:** pin the fixture's model so it compiles without a host credential ([82371ea](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/82371ea4a7726ba26f872c7c83773ffa4147c047))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The hand-off publish test passed locally and failed on main. C018 rejects an agent node that names neither `model:` nor `backend:` UNLESS the runtime can detect a credential — so a developer machine with Claude Code OAuth compiles the fixture and CI, which has none, does not.

    </details>
* **handoff:** publishing the fallback let a crashed review shadow a complete one ([4bd82c8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4bd82c830b7ddc6bc707b64709ed16638d14c54d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The live dogfood found the hand-off resolving to nothing, and the first read of the evidence — no artifacts on any cloud run, zero `artifact_written` events — pointed at cloud storage. That was wrong, and the correction is the whole fix.

    </details>
* **launch:** a bot launched off the board could not publish anything ([5157144](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/51571448218e848abbdb6364853cb7292c71fd5d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The cloud coordinator launches a card from its BotArgs alone, so two things the webhook tail composes inline never reached it: the forge-publish grant and the repo's launch policy. A board-mode fixer therefore pushed its commits and then had nowhere to post — no verdict, no ledger, no merge-gate status — leaving the repo's required check on the pre-push revision, which blocks the PR on a check that is absent rather than red. Measured side by side with the reviewer on the same PR.

    </details>
* **launch:** the stale provisioning was winning a re-provisioned repo ([cdfedc1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cdfedc12406e5a37d2c3702a67b787d5cabc2cc2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Resolving one repo among several provisionings by lowest id is deterministic and arbitrary. On the e2e repo it picks the row from 2026-07-17, on a personal token, over the GitHub App it was deliberately re-provisioned onto — so the verdict would be posted under the operator's own account, which is the identity whose comments the loop guard refuses.

    </details>
* **webhooks:** the fixer's push was the one delivery the gate never saw ([db2676c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/db2676c5b9605185c77988696f3afed9b3ed0579))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The iterion-bot guard skips a pull request our own loop produced, keyed on the sender. On a merge-gate resync the sender is by construction our own forge bot — a fixer that just pushed onto someone else's PR — so the guard swallowed the delivery the whole gate depends on.

## [3.18.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.17.7...v3.18.0) (2026-07-31)

### Features

* **branch-improve-loop:** let the operator choose where they sit in the loop ([d81c0bf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d81c0bf7f5663c11d09f1fdb1d1f8002015f3ed9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A reviewer alone already puts the human in the middle: findings land, the human decides which to act on and how. The fixer is the more invasive option, and offering only it would take that arbitration away — you either read findings yourself, or you hand the whole thing over.

    </details>
* **branch-improve-loop:** speak for the head you pushed, and never green it for free ([6398c48](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6398c487d7587a7ca6ee87e5b102b99603ab2b6f)), references [#322](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/322)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A fixer that pushes moves the head, and the merge-gate status stays on the old one. A required check that is ABSENT is indistinguishable from one still running: the pull request waits for a context that will never arrive, with every other check green and nothing pointing at why. That is the failure #322 was written for, and pushing commits creates it on purpose.

    </details>
* **detect:** report pi, so the preference variable and the studio can see it ([a4be02b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a4be02b10dc0f8e153755e62c2fe86fd1d1e1045))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    pi was reachable only by naming it on a node. Auto-selection filters on what Detect reports, so ITERION_BACKEND_PREFERENCE=pi was inert, and the studio's backend panel and Settings → Backends could not show it at all — for the one backend whose whole proposition is "you already hold a credential for one of ~36 providers".

    </details>
* **gate:** a red merge gate can launch the fixer itself, if the repo asks ([057be3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/057be3aae1fcaeba0d2c0c2f9b6a73241cb17364))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    only those. The default stays as it was, and that is the decision rather than caution: a reviewer already leaves the developer in the middle (findings land, they choose what to act on, and a comment hands the work over whenever they want). Turning the hand-over automatic everywhere would take that arbitration from every developer on the repo to save one comment.

    </details>
* **handoff:** a reviewer and a fixer cooperate without the engine naming either ([fc3e342](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fc3e3423b396d9932ca66286d4cf92685da04756))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The run-to-run hand-off was written as a pair of hardcoded identities: a `botID != "branch-improve-loop"` guard, a producer pinned to "review-pr", and that bot's three node names (`converge`, `merge_reviews`, `diff_precheck`) as engine constants. So the engine knew which bot reviews, which bot fixes, and the internal graph shape of one of them — the coupling CLAUDE.md forbids, and the reason a second reviewer or a second fixer needed an engine PR rather than a bundle.

    </details>
* **handoff:** the fixer answers the review, finding by finding ([cbdad61](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cbdad61a1f198d779d4df28511524c6ac22e0d20))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The hand-off ran one way. A reviewer handed over N findings with stable ids, and the reply was a prose summary: the PR author was shown N problems and then told "hardened this PR", with no way to see which were answered, which were dismissed, and on what grounds. A later review, given nothing, re-raised whatever the fixer had silently decided against — the oscillating relay ADR-058 removed from the catalog, reconstituted across two bots.

    </details>
* **pi:** drive the openai-codex provider from the host's Codex login ([83cb5e5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/83cb5e56ca12a3ecca396cdd3f111339cbc9bcbf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    pi reaches ~30 providers through an API-key environment variable and `openai-codex` through none of them: that provider is OAuth-only, its tokens live in pi's own auth.json, and they are minted by an interactive `/login`. So a host already holding a working Codex credential — the very file iterion reads for claw's ChatGPT-forfait path — could not hand it to pi at all, and `backend: "pi"` on a ChatGPT plan was unreachable. Verified two ways before building anything: pi's provider table lists an…

    </details>
* **pi:** keep per-run state out of the target repo's checkout ([74b71f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/74b71f0c7fbc2763c7a32fb1abb631fef631c456))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Five review rounds in a row found holes in the guards protecting <WorkDir>/.iterion/pi — a symlink at a component, at the leaf, at the .gitignore inside it; a relative root that made containment fail open; a pre-seeded .gitignore whose last effective rule re-included our files. Each fix was correct and each left an adjacent hole, because they all patch the same premise: iterion writes a credential and a session transcript into a directory the target repository controls.

    </details>
* **reviews:** the review hand-off carries the patch it already wrote ([208852f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/208852fb4be4f2fc00b15dd97928387123b07838))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Seeding the fixer with the reviewer's findings exists to save it a round. The digest was dropping the fields that do exactly that.

    </details>
* **runtime:** the engine reports which skills it owns, so a backend can trust them ([b4abbdf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b4abbdfb3e6a2dc637df7e207e12322e41e6357f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The durable fix for a boundary my last two attempts only pretended to hold. pi is launched with `--no-approve` to refuse the target repo's project-local resources, but `--skill` paths bypass that gate — so handing pi `<workDir>/.claude/skills` loaded whatever the repository itself ships there, as a trusted skill, on every node. For a webhook-launched review or triage bot against an untrusted repo that is attacker-authored prompt text.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** the other two writers under <WorkDir>/.iterion refuse a repo symlink too ([8183b6b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8183b6b73516068df26deaa8026c59a83258cb0b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi raised this as an open question rather than a finding: if a repo-committed `.iterion` symlink is in the threat model for the credential, it is in scope for the composed system prompt and the session guard, which MkdirAll through the same path. It is — and the primitive is arguably worse there: a repo choosing where a host file lands, with directories created along the way, out of a path iterion picked.

    </details>
* **gate:** the zero-touch lane had no working brake ([b066d3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b066d3aec8e22a990be42d89df140fd5881fe82c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A simplify pass and an adversarial pass over the new lane. The two agreed on the same root cause from opposite directions: the launch tail was hand-rolled instead of reusing `launchWebhookTarget`, and everything that copy silently dropped was load-bearing.

    </details>
* **handoff:** five ways the gate went green when it should not have ([e862915](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e86291598a166d3b109b3ffa56d6ceeb0b93eb86))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial pass over the branch. Two of these would have merged unfixed code through a required check.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Moving the seed into the shared launch tail covered every lane but the one that matters most for a `/command` bot: with a cloud dispatcher active, a board-mode command materialises a card and RETURNS — the card is the launch, and the coordinator launches from BotArgs only. The tail is never reached, so the seed was dropped on exactly the path `/billy` takes in production, with no error and the bot falling back to its DSL default.

    </details>
* **pi:** --skill must not smuggle the target repo's own skills past --no-approve ([a951e6f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a951e6f63ad45edb491bc05cbc4c8db844ed4243))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A security regression I introduced with the bundle-skill fix, caught by Revi. Widening the gate from `len(task.SkillHints) > 0` to "the mirror directory is non-empty" changed WHAT gets handed over, not just how much: `<workDir>/.claude/skills` is a checkout of the TARGET repository under `worktree: auto`, so a repo committing its own `.claude/skills/x/SKILL.md` had that markdown loaded into every pi node as an explicitly-supplied skill.

    </details>
* **pi:** a bundle's skills must reach pi ([1dd232c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1dd232c0c900c1f1bd9c48887608860f37bdcd43))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The --skill flag was gated on `len(task.SkillHints) > 0`, which is the wrong signal. SkillHints carries ONLY the DSL `skills:` field — the skill LIBRARY — while every BUNDLE skill is mirrored into <workDir>/.claude/skills/ without ever touching it. So for a bundle bot the flag was never emitted: pi had zero skill awareness, and an agent whose own prompt ordered "LOAD YOUR SKILLS FIRST" was left hunting for files it had no way to see.

    </details>
* **pi:** a relative workdir disarmed the guard entirely, and the walk covered only the credential ([67fd79e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/67fd79e50c25130df3e39f90e32b296222f0d2bb))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

* **pi:** gitignore is last-match-wins, so a `*` anywhere proved nothing ([1d13476](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1d1347619068098ec877abcd5e51990fe5e90fa0))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Same fail-open shape as the symlink series, one layer up in the PARSING. piWriteIgnoreGuard short-circuited on any line trimming to `*`, but git resolves ignore rules last-match-wins: a repo committing `.iterion/pi/.gitignore` with `*\n!auth.json` (or plainly `*\n!*`) made the function return "already guarded" having written nothing, leaving the seeded ChatGPT access + refresh token stageable by a campaign agent's `git add -A` and fast-forwarded onto the operator's branch.

    </details>
* **pi:** guard the directory pi actually writes into, and stop failing a legitimate store symlink ([5a39c1e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5a39c1ec63d55afe62fe50b15f3fb87539034e17))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous commit put the symlink refusal in writeSystemPromptFile, which was wrong twice over. It could never be the boundary — that function is SKIPPED for a node with an empty system prompt, and for pi `AppendToNative` means an agent node with only a `prompt:` yields exactly that — so `.iterion/pi` as a tracked symlink still redirected the extension bundle and pi's own session transcripts, which carry the node's full conversation. And it was over-broad: it refused a symlinked `.iterion`,…

    Revi caught an asymmetry I created in the previous commit: I added the ignore-guard verification to the SANDBOXED branch only, while the store branch writes to <StoreDir>/pi with no equivalent check — and this repo's own dogfood instructions prescribe `--store-dir "$PWD/.iterion"`, which puts the store inside the git repo. So the non-sandboxed path carried the exact `git add -A` exposure the sandboxed one had just been hardened against, and the new refusal made the inconsistency look deliberate.

* **pi:** ITERION_PI_BIN is a host path, and a source name is not a set variable ([f36e7e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f36e7e1b33890066fadff531bc2159861998f1af))

    Revi round 19, both real.

* **pi:** keep the ChatGPT token out of git, and stop refusing nodes we do not fund ([7903c78](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7903c781a2cf3a48a1fe0011bbb41d7661c0008c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A driver whose workspace is a COPY of the host's (kubernetes tar-streams it at pod start) never sees a host-side write made afterwards. pi is handed three files BY PATH — the iterion extension, the composed system prompt, the openai-codex credential — and resolves them inside the pod, so all three were missing there. Caught by the first live cloud run of the backend (019fb968): every attempt died on `Extension path does not exist`, and the other two would have degraded silently, which is worse.

    </details>
* **pi:** make the zero-skill warning reachable, and stop the guard eating a .gitignore ([b4c9e20](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b4c9e209f36a5682af90de398f7184ff03d976d6))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The diagnostic that says "pi got no skills" was written and then never wired: piSkillArgs took a logger, both transports passed nil, and the failure it exists to report — the agent hunting for files its own prompt told it to load — stayed as silent as before. Both argv builders now carry the backend's logger, and the warning fires on the case that matters: the engine named skills and none of them resolved.

    </details>
* **pi:** one --skill per skill, and make detection read what the run reads ([b56fbf3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b56fbf300ea55507ee36051cd1862f560a5a5f90))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Six defects from an adversarial review of the bridge. The two that mattered were both mine reasoning backwards from an untested assumption.

    Adversarial round 2, aimed at the previous round's FIXES because that is where the last five rounds found the defect. It held.

* **pi:** the ignore guard must not follow a symlink the checkout shipped ([a37a99d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a37a99d9760802b5a5418f2a75f04cda2fec3ce2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The path guards walk TO the seed root; none of them looks INSIDE it. And MkdirAll is a no-op on a `.iterion/pi` the checkout pre-populated, so a repo can ship `.iterion/pi/.gitignore` as a tracked symlink. Two things follow, and the second is the one that matters:

    </details>
* **pi:** the last two Revi findings, one of them my own argument turned on me ([4fcef55](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4fcef55128417c2c64468b6cd0d4bd2bfda80900))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    **detect's Codex probe was more optimistic than the bridge that consumes the credential.** codexChatGPTAvailable hand-rolled a parse accepting `auth_mode: "chatgpt"` alone, while piCodexSeed gates on CodexCredentialsView.IsChatGPTMode — which also requires an access token and an account id. So a partially-written or logged-out Codex state made detect report pi available, the preference variable resolved there, and the bridge then stepped aside and left the node to die with "No API key found for…

    </details>
* **pi:** the sibling ignore guard had the same symlink hole, one level up ([c83e885](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c83e885ecc8abbcb9c1b54f69963698320126b17))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Third instance of one shape, so this shares the CHECK rather than adding a third copy of it. piHideWorkspaceSessionDir used a FOLLOWING os.Stat on <WorkDir>/.iterion/.gitignore, which a repo can ship as a tracked symlink. Both outcomes were bad and the second was silent: a DANGLING link made os.WriteFile create an attacker-chosen host file, and a link to any existing path made the stat succeed, so the function returned as if the workspace were guarded — leaving pi's session transcripts and the…

    </details>
* **pi:** treat Revi's five findings on the pi follow-ups ([d269907](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d269907f6c19b8c9ed1c2bb848c0d58e5b80e2ec))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    **high — the stale-seed sweep deleted a live peer's credential.** I added the sweep to fix an adversarial-review finding (a SIGKILL strands tokens) and asserted an invariant that is false: "anything already here when a new node starts is by definition abandoned". The root is SHARED — by every node of a run under sandbox, and off it by every run in the store — while iterion permits parallel branches and the studio runs several pipelines at once. A second openai-codex node therefore swept the…

    </details>
* **pi:** write our own ignore guard instead of trusting one we did not author ([1ee62d1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1ee62d10e0a9ff3271ca8e49453bf9f5ab82e671))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's high finding, and it is the root cause of the two patches before it: the guard verified `<workDir>/.iterion/.gitignore` no matter where the seed root actually landed. That file is best-effort, is deliberately never overwritten when the repo already tracks one, and says nothing about a root `--store-dir` put elsewhere under the worktree. So the check could pass while the credential sat somewhere it did not cover.

    </details>
* **runtime:** back the sandbox scratch with a shared, persistent host dir ([#330](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/330)) ([9c8e0e2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9c8e0e2a278db652ede08ce3482fe553c8b4b01d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A sub-bot child runs in its OWN container. ${PROJECT_SCRATCH_DIR} resolved to a container-local /tmp/iterion-scratch, so the file a child wrote there was invisible to the parent that later read the same path. The child reported success, the parent read an empty directory, and the run only failed much later — as "not enough results", far from the cause.

    </details>
* **runtime:** library skills ride the ownership channel, and the seed root refuses a symlink ([8121570](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8121570d858e30b8fccf2a15c5c8fe34f20ea4c5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A skill hint is not provenance. One is recorded for every skill the workflow's `skills:` field references — INCLUDING one the target repo pre-empted, because the hint describes what the agent will see, not who wrote it. piSkillArgs derived `<workspace>/.claude/skills/<name>` from that name, so an untrusted checkout that shipped a same-named skill got its own file handed to pi as a trusted `--skill`: precisely the routing-around-`--no-approve` the gate exists to close.

    </details>
* **runtime:** own the FILE, not the directory a repo can pre-populate ([cbee1e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cbee1e1d4c27202cb45b874e9795e0b90e43e816))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A flat bundle source writes <stem>/SKILL.md, and MkdirAll succeeds happily on a <stem>/ the checkout already ships. Reporting that DIRECTORY as owned therefore vouched for whatever the target repo planted beside our file: a repo committing .claude/skills/whats-next/evil.md (no SKILL.md, so nothing shadows) got the whole directory back on the owned list. Naming the one file we wrote cannot carry a sibling. Library skills had the identical shape and get the same treatment; the directory-form…

    </details>
* **runtime:** plugin skills reach pi, and directory skills survive a resume ([65227b0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/65227b04ffdfc2a41c247c45148a413ec167210a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two regressions the engine-owned skill list introduced, both silent.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The shared subscription-OAuth warning asserted that "third-party apps bill against your EXTRA USAGE balance, not your plan limits" for ANY provider, interpolating only the name. That sentence describes Anthropic's arrangement, measured live during the pi work. Applied to OpenAI it states a billing model nobody here verified — and an operator reading a confident sentence acts on it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion run project/bots/x/main.bot` resolved its store from the .bot's own directory, so a bot living inside the project it drives was keyed on that subdirectory: the run landed in ~/.iterion/projects/<project-bots-x-key>/ while resume, inspect, issue, dispatch and the studio all resolve <project>/.iterion. Launching succeeded and every follow-up reported "run not found" — the run was invisible to the board and could not be resumed.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    /dev/shm defaults to 64 MB in a container, and the renderer blocks there rather than erroring. The symptom is not a crash but a page that never finishes loading: the load event does not come, and the load ceiling fires while blaming the host's speed. Measured on a real runner — 240 seconds on the first page, instant on the same page locally.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A net that watches HTTP responses sees the markup change; it cannot say what degraded. Removing an accessible name moves an HTML reference and nothing in the report distinguishes it from a reworded label.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The net and the existing test suite both watch the same repository and both claim to protect against regression. Comparing them by assertion is worthless; `suite-vs-net.py` applies every mutant in turn and runs the target's own suite, so one set of trials produces both figures.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A net that watches HTTP responses and rendered documents does not watch the files a page loads. On the repository this bot was exercised against, the whole client layer — every stylesheet, every vendor script, the view framework itself — was absent from the environment and answered 404, and not one reference moved. A total absence of the client layer was indistinguishable from its presence.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The engine created every run with CreateRun and stamped ParentRunID in a follow-up SaveRun. Between the two writes the row existed, was `running`, and had no parent — and a row with no parent is indistinguishable from a top-level run, which is exactly what the orphan reconciler judges. Every subbot child goes through this path: the runtime spawns them, and only Service.Launch pre-creates its own rows.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a `file` schema field type so a human node can ask the operator for bytes, not just text: the studio renders a file picker at the gate, the answer is uploaded to the run, and the runtime promotes it to a run attachment before the workflow resumes. `iterion resume --answer key=@./path` accepts the same fields from the CLI.

### Bug Fixes

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    enablePullRequestAutoMerge only accepts a PR with something left to wait for; GitHub answers UNPROCESSABLE "Pull request is in clean status" otherwise. The audit takes longer than CI, so that is the ordinary case: a live run on socialgouv/buildkit-operator#5 posted its gate green and then armed nothing, leaving the PR open with every check passing.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Mutant reverts are `git checkout -- <file>`, restoring HEAD. The gate captures references from the working tree it starts with, the first file mutant snaps those files back to HEAD, and every capture after that describes something else. Uncommitted work is destroyed on the way, silently, and the verdict belongs to no tree that ever existed.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git init` creates .git before the fetch and checkout land, and Fetch treated the presence of .git as "this tree is complete". On a cold pod taking several launches at once, the losers of that race were handed a directory holding nothing but .git — and the plugin loader then reported it as "has no plugin.yaml and no skills/", a 502 that names the wrong cause and blocks every launch for the tenant.

    In mono only one reviewer runs, and an {{outputs.<absent node>.<field>}} reference renders as a LITERAL placeholder rather than as nothing — so the merging agent was shown what looks like a broken template instead of "that family did not run".

    A missing python3 surfaced as "the canonicaliser tests FAIL" — a message that accuses the net when the environment is what is absent. Seen for real on a CI image nobody had checked carried an interpreter. The whole net is Python; saying so plainly costs one line and saves an hour of looking in the wrong place.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the replayability check no longer reports success when it cannot tell ([fd7bd99](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fd7bd990ea0663beb6cc091ac3019efcf8f8ef8d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git check-ignore` returns 0 for ignored, 1 for not, and 128 when there is no repository or no git. The check only looked at 0, so on any workspace that is not a checkout it discriminated NOTHING and left `runner_replayable: true` — the good outcome, reported for the one reason it could not see. Some CI runners hand the job a COPY of the tracked files rather than a checkout, which is exactly where this happens.

### Features

* **cli:** add --commit flag to version command ([#52](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/52)) ([a8af8ee](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a8af8eef89c0c03ced48bcf09588ca70801b4051))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion version --commit` prints only the bare git commit SHA on a single line (via cli.RawCommit()), so scripts can capture the SHA directly without parsing the full human-readable version string. The default `iterion version` output is unchanged. Output now goes through cmd.OutOrStdout() so the command is testable against a captured buffer.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Answering a paused `human` node from the studio (pipeline-board card or run console) could silently do nothing and lose the reviewer's notes. Verified end-to-end in a real browser (Playwright against the built SPA).

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** promote_audit commits what it promotes ([ae26833](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ae268339e95b5c6bd1d01fc21af74f04b720e7db))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Moving files into the worktree is not publishing them. The worktree is destroyed when the run ends, so a promotion that only moves has produced nothing that outlives the run -- while reporting promoted: 8.

    </details>
* **reviewtopology:** make mono the default review topology ([03309fd](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/03309fdb365b9f6a7a15896af024b0d22599bbac))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi ran BOTH family reviewers on every review, unconditionally: it never declared the ADR-052 topology vars (its only review_mode-looking var is pr_review_mode, an unrelated inline/summary publish setting), so InjectIfDeclared no-op'd on it and there was no frugal path at all. With the merge gate wired, review_on_sync re-reviews on every push — so each push cost two full reviewer passes on an instance that should be running mono.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `forge_publish_url` is the FULL endpoint URL, not a base — Revi uses it verbatim. Vetty appended the path to it, so it POSTed to `…/api/v1/forge/publish-review/api/v1/forge/publish-review`.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The human-arbitration escape hatch for the Revi merge gate: a trusted maintainer comments `/revi approve [reason]` on a PR to force-green the `revi/review` commit status on the current head, for a finding they dispute — without launching a re-review and without needing admin merge-queue bypass.

## [3.9.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.9.0...v3.9.1) (2026-07-28)

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** one rule for the sealed path, asked rather than copied ([b8ab790](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b8ab7901d5ac5135676d78e20e3e52a5bd116885))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The morning's fix made the campaign and the gate DERIVE the sealed path from the same rule instead of one dictating it to the other. The very next commit added a third party -- the node promoting a spent set to published evidence -- carrying its own hand-written copy of that derivation. It resolved into a different repository's scratch entirely, promoted nothing, and reported success.

    </details>
* **runview+cli:** a paused run advertised resumable before it was, and the group guard demanded a contract three groups already had ([#307](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/307)) ([2cf72f3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2cf72f37cdfad8464d526fe28456841c99ce9761)), closes [#5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/5)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    When a run parks on a human gate the engine writes paused_waiting_human to the STORE, returns ErrRunPaused, and only then does the goroutine carrying it call Deregister on its way out. Between those, the public signal says "resumable" while the handle is still held — and the studio and the pipeline-board sidebar offer Resume on exactly that signal. A resume landing in the window failed with `run "..." is already registered`, which reads as a bug to an operator and is one to any automated chain…

    </details>

## [3.9.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.8.1...v3.9.0) (2026-07-28)

### Features

* **bots:** modernize (Morphy) — gate-to-gate lots against an oracle it cannot rewrite ([f7b72e9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f7b72e9c0609b09b2955316811969c766500d271))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The unit of work is the LOT, not the package. A dependency-upgrade pipeline whose failure path is revert-this-package-and-continue cannot express a runtime move that touches nine hundred files at once, so this is a separate bot rather than a widening of that one.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a spent held-out set becomes published evidence ([8ce6b92](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8ce6b922a0cd33778fc8c9f822f3c033a5b204cf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The sealed set protected the hardening loop and then vanished with the run, which left the committed net unable to support its own headline claim. A third party could read '7/7 held-out detected' and had exactly as much reason to believe it as they have to believe any delivery's self-reported figures — which is to say none, and that is precisely the criticism this bot exists to make.

    </details>
* **model:** move the fleet to the Claude 5 family, and read the generation instead of listing it ([1978c3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1978c3a773bae49575748b7165e7cd8172d9e07f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Reasoning capability was decided by a list of known model ids. A list is silent when it is wrong: a model absent from it is classified as non-reasoning, extended thinking is never requested, and the run pays full price for a degraded answer without a single warning. claude-opus-5 matched none of the five patterns.

    </details>
* **models:** audit committed prices against the ones already being fetched ([02d84c0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/02d84c0f172efc7a381c43f9472490d5b19443ed))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    iterion downloads model pricing from the spec aggregator, caches it for 24h, and never reads it: InputCostPerM and OutputCostPerM were parsed and dropped, with no consumer anywhere in the tree. Meanwhile the cost estimator asks a different live source and falls back to a hand-maintained table. Two sources of truth for the same number, never compared.

    </details>
* **reviews+deps:** one merge gate per repo, and Vetty guards Renovate PRs end-to-end ([#306](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/306)) ([eac354f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/eac354f80affd55a8570611743d4dd7cb9ce4c98)), references [#300](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/300)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A repo webhook could only ever launch a single bot per delivery: SelectBot() returns "" as soon as two bots are enabled, so the lane fell back to the hardcoded "review-pr". Co-enabling a dependency guard and a reviewer therefore lost the guard entirely, and — because the shared AuthorAllowlist is the union of every bot's, nil as soon as one bot is open — the guard's author filter was discarded too.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a spent held-out set is not a broken seal ([b14faca](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b14facac8c0c3797ef1faab944ae54e15aef96bf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Publishing the set created a third way to have nothing to score, and the harness knew only two. A replay after promotion accused the operator of having cleared the seal, when the set had in fact been scored once and published exactly as designed.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** enforce the corpus width floor, on distinct references ([0b428ec](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0b428ec2d21523e1c57eb67e73f5099cf2a6ca40))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    min_corpus existed only in the campaign prompt. The harness never read it and the gate never checked it: a corpus of three entries passed as long as the three were seen. Same shape as the seal that was guaranteed by a sentence in a skill — an obligation stated to the agent with nothing behind it.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** fail the gate when the emitted net cannot be replayed ([5b23373](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5b23373328fa89f78e79f603556c0a918f7dc1c8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The first net this bot emitted was not runnable from a clean checkout. The campaign gitignored harness.py — defensible-looking, since it is a copy of a bundle file — so the committed oracle was references plus a runner shelling out to a script that does not travel. Checked out fresh, verify-oracle.sh exits 2 with 'No such file'.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** resolve the base URL instead of baking it ([b3b6804](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b3b680449f8390576d3fdbac97ca8f3824526f11))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The emitted net recorded base_url as a literal. Ports are derived from the repository path — the fix for two checkouts fighting over one port, where the bad case is not a refused start but the second copy capturing the first one's application and recording a net that describes a different tree. A literal therefore pins the net to the machine AND the path that recorded it.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the emitted runner exits red when the gate is red ([f77b3f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f77b3f01b134f66f53e61bd1921c6507256991cb))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    verify-oracle.sh printed the report and exited 0 no matter what the verdict was. The graph never noticed, because it reads the JSON and computes the conjunction itself — but this script is the entry point for CI and for humans, and both read exit codes. A runner that reports a red gate and exits 0 IS a blind judge, one level above the one this bot was built to catch.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the negative control covers the whole corpus ([e773e6c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e773e6c581e064df91f00183c34457457cc63466))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    It sampled the first six entries, which left every later entry never once confronted with its own reference. A reference could be stale, or frozen against a world that had since moved, and nothing would say so unless a mutant happened to target it. That is a hole in the one guard whose job is to prove the comparators are not noisy.

    </details>
* **model:** resolve bare model names deterministically, by consensus ([c2d00a3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c2d00a30411a40ec432cf1d8974ed961743c8f60))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The bare-name index was built by assigning into a map while ranging over one. Go randomises map iteration, so a model published by several providers resolved to a DIFFERENT provider's numbers on every process start. Five consecutive runs of the same command produced five different prices for glm-5.2, one of them zero.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous fix scoped the seal to the run by forcing GM_SEALED_DIR at the gate. The campaign seals too — the golden-master skill has it run selfcheck — in another process, without that environment. It therefore fell back to the shared gm-holdout path and MOVED the held-out set there, after which the gate looked in the run-scoped path, found nothing, and would have bailed on a seal it had itself broken.

    Found live on the merge gate's own PR #292 (run 019f98ed): revi/review posted `failure | 1 blocking finding` while the review body said "0 findings kept". Root cause: the converge/emit LLM returned `findings` as a PROSE STRING ("4 findings kept (0 critical, 1 high, 2 medium, 1 low)…") instead of the JSON array of objects the schema intends. `findings: json` accepts a string (the DSL has no object-array type), so nothing rejected it. Downstream, publish_review's `JSON.parse(FINDINGS)` fails →…

## [3.7.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.6.1...v3.7.0) (2026-07-25)

### Features

* **forge:** iterion remote forge refresh — re-sync a connection's grants now ([#298](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/298)) ([75c02e9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/75c02e91e3a0f48d62bd3da582ca2987b61435a8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Operability tool motivated by the merge-gate rollout: after changing a GitHub App's permissions (e.g. granting Commit statuses: write), an operator had to wait for the periodic refresh worker or restart the whole server for iterion to pick up the new grant. This adds a targeted, explicit refresh.

    Live prod e2e of the merge gate proved the full chain works end-to-end (Revi reviews → bot sends the deterministic gate verdict → server resolves the head SHA → SetCommitStatus), but the status did not land: the GitHub App lacks "Commit statuses: write", so SetCommitStatus returns 403 "insufficient scope". The code handles it exactly as designed — non-fatal, reported in gate_error, logged (`forge gate: … not posted: … insufficient scope`) — so the gate advises instead of blocking until the…

* **review-pr:** second publish_review shell bug — bare double-quote truncates ([#294](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/294)) ([c06e0e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c06e0e1c57439a57e2af7f593fa1b60300ae37d7)), references [#293](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/293) [#293](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/293) [#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The e2e re-run (after #293) still failed: publish_review produced EMPTY output (exit 0, no forge review, no revi/review status), then publish_health crashed on the empty inputs. Root cause: a python COMMENT in the publish_review body contained bare double-quotes ("high"/"blocker"/"major"). The body is wrapped by the shell in `python3 -c "…"`, so a bare double-quote ends the string and silently truncates the script. Same trap as backticks; distinct from the #293 questions-array bug (both were…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The v0.5.0 questions channel passed a JSON array of strings through the publish_review tool node as QUESTIONS={{input.questions}}. A `json`-typed field holding an all-string array decodes to []string, which the tool-command substitution SPACE-JOINS instead of JSON-encoding (known engine bug, executor_tool.go:1047) — so the 2nd+ question landed in shell command position and bash exit-127'd, crashing the entire review (no forge review, no revi/review gate status). findings escaped this because…

### Bug Fixes

* **docs-refresh:** scope_check bases on run-start HEAD, not oldest reflog ([40ae433](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/40ae43322b6e1d9fa47529c640937895bc2e00f9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In amend-on-PR mode the cloud runner clones the base branch (HEAD=main) then checks out the PR head, so the OLDEST reflog entry is main. scope_check diffed against it and folded the PR author's OWN code into the changed set, raising a phantom writeable-set violation that pinned scope_ok=false — so `converged` never fired and every amend run burned all its passes (live run 019f9429). Base the diff instead on the run-start HEAD: the newest reflog entry that is not one of this run's own `Bot:…

* **studio:** "Open child bot" 404 → resolve child path against the right parent ([#285](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/285)) ([c7f6aab](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c7f6aab39c3f7fa88636921b76825a6e783a6f52))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Clicking "Open child bot" from the editor inspector could 404 (and, in a follow-up, silently open nothing): the child .bot path is resolved from the parent file with `resolveSubbotSource(parentFilePath, source)`, but `parentFilePath` (document store `currentFilePath`) can be null during the short route-hydration window — arriving from Pipelines activates the editor tab one render before EditorTabHost copies the file into the document store.

    git log --grep 'Bot: docs-refresh' matched any commit MENTIONING the trailer in prose — including this bot's own v3.5 feature commit (caught on the first live check against origin/main, where it picked 1a5eddf29 over the real last alignment #288). Anchor to a line start (-E --grep '^Bot: docs-refresh') so only actual trailer lines count. Test now commits a prose-mention after the alignment commit and asserts the base stays the real alignment commit.

    A cloud/sandboxed run reaches the internet through iterion's egress proxy, injected as HTTPS_PROXY and advertised at the runner's own (necessarily private) pod IP — the trusted egress boundary and the secret-redaction point (started even in `network: open` whenever a SecretRewriter is present). urllib then dials the PROXY, not the feed host, so Vigie's socket-level getaddrinfo guard rejected our own proxy as "SSRF-unsafe address <pod-ip>" and every feed failed (run 019f8feb: all 69 fetches…

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **docs-refresh:** plan-then-execute comprehensive, asymptote on honest declaration (3.1.0)

### Features

* **docs-refresh:** plan-then-execute comprehensive, asymptote on honest declaration (3.1.0) ([3b8dd24](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3b8dd2486f1c820cacbddfdaf9942a8579cc60d3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    3.0 was fast/cheap but under-delivered — it handled the ~10 advisory hints, surveyed shallowly, and honestly-but-myopically declared docs_aligned after one ~15-min pass, producing tiny PRs on a 250-doc corpus with weeks of unread semantic drift. The fix is framing, not a coverage gate: an audited.json exhaustiveness checklist was drafted and REJECTED as exactly the excess determinism 3.0 removed (it makes the agent do bookkeeping instead of the job).

    </details>
* **docs-refresh:** self-orchestrated coverage — campaign fans out its own subagents (3.2.0) ([cd6c92b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cd6c92bd0a816e596ecbd59d23e565a16e5d44b9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A live 3-way benchmark (this repo, 2026-07-23) settled why 3.0/3.1 shipped tiny PRs: a SINGLE campaign agent — exactly like a free native agent handed the same one-liner — self-scopes to the headline docs and misses the long tail. By rising coverage: Doki (~3 commits/pass, docs/ only) < native one-liner (6 fixes, missed cloud + bot READMEs) < native with a demanding prompt (reached the WHOLE corpus). The only run that got there DECOMPOSED into per-cluster sub-auditors ON ITS OWN.

    </details>
* **server,studio:** full cloud bot editing — team-authored bot store ([8850fd6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8850fd630020be5f84bceb6da074d09d90e95711))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a writable, team-scoped bot store so the studio editor works in cloud, not only on a local filesystem. The cloud catalog stays baked read-only; tenant bots are editable and forkable.

    </details>
* **studio:** multi-file bundle editor for cloud bots ([4444448](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4444448a3e6b91eedbbfce1a9091ed09881831b3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a "Bundle files" drawer (Toolbar, shown only for a botsource:// tenant bot) listing the bundle's files. main.bot opens in the DSL Canvas; skills/*.md, manifest.yaml and any other file edit inline in a Monaco buffer and save per-file to the bot-source store. New files can be added and non-main files removed. Reuses the FileEditDialog Monaco pattern + inferMonacoLanguage; the tab-kind system is untouched.

    </details>
* **webhooks:** PR-open auto-reviews only (Revi); Billy on /billy with Revi's review ([#283](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/283)) ([463646d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/463646dc66235863df2a4611f76cc7d1ec35d53c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Decouple the mutating branch-improve loop (Billy) from PR-open auto-launch: a PR/MR open now ONLY ever auto-reviews (Revi / review-pr). Removes the selectForgePRBot ticket-PR→Billy routing; the merge-queue auto-heal path (NeedsAutoHeal) is unchanged.

* **docs-refresh:** budgets sized for self-orchestration (3.2.1) ([7213fc6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7213fc6c2dc0afad2cc7a9694c3cd283b71d3058))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    First 3.2.0 live run (019f8e08) aligned 40 docs across the whole corpus in pass 1 (~70 min / ~$16) — the win — but the old 2h/$60 caps guillotined it mid-pass-2 as a hard failed_resumable BEFORE finalize, and all 40 in-pod commits were lost (the exporter only runs on a clean finalize; engine gap tracked separately). Comprehensive self-orchestrated passes are long: max_duration 2h→6h, max_cost_usd 60→120, max_passes 8→4 so the asymptote reaches GRACEFUL exhaustion (which finalizes + exports +…

* **native:** unique-title prefix must respect the caller's rune budget ([89787a9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/89787a938024ac6adf37bc22b9b4eb1112948435)), references [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N) [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N) [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N)

    The atomic CreateUniqueTitle prepended "#N - " to the desired title without re-truncating, so a pipeline-board title already compacted to 80 runes became 85 once made unique — deterministically failing TestPipelineBoardTaskCreateEnsuresUniqueTitle (the server's list-then-check fallback already re-compacted; the atomic path didn't). CreateUniqueTitle now takes an optional `normalize func(string) string` applied to every candidate inside the lock; the pipeline board passes compactPipelineTitle so…

* **runner:** budget-exceeded acks (no auto-resume) — stop the git-meta clobber ([266e6ad](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/266e6ad98739b23265a33a2e2fad1cd3306abd81))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ErrBudgetExceeded fell through to the generic Nak, so a budget-exceeded run (a resumable checkpoint) was auto-redelivered and resumed. That was doubly destructive: the same message carries the same already-spent budget, so a duration cap re-fails instantly in a pod-provisioning loop; and each redelivery re-provisions a FRESH pod whose recordRunGitMeta overwrites the first attempt's good git metadata with base==head — silently destroying the run's exported commits. Live: run 019f8e08 (Doki 3.2)…

* **server:** tenant bot gallery slug — botregistry Path is the bundle dir ([6e679a1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6e679a164629f64eac6ecc2c5188307823dc12f2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    tenantBotEntries re-keys a discovered tenant bundle to its store slug, since a forked bot's manifest name (e.g. "docs-refresh") differs from its slug and would otherwise collide with the catalog bot of that name and never surface under its own id. slugFromMaterializedPath wrongly required ≥2 path segments, but botregistry sets Entry.Path to the bundle DIRECTORY ("<root>/<slug>"), a single segment — so the slug was never applied and the tenant bot vanished from the gallery / 404'd on GET.

* **studio:** reach editor home with tabs open + in-editor "Duplicate & edit" ([d877725](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d8777255bc80db5eefa61e64c2735e359f0243a5))

* **studio:** read-only editor for catalog bots in cloud (no more 500 on Save) ([05102a0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/05102a0c7fcc15bd19921441e07b1bd89a48c51d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Opening a baked catalog bot in the cloud editor bound a filesystem path (/opt/iterion/bots/<bot>/main.bot); Save then hit /api/files/save and 500'd with "permission denied" (the image is read-only, and cloud has no writable workspace). Only a team-authored bot (botsource:// path) is writable in cloud.

    </details>
* **studio:** replace window.confirm/prompt with accessible dialogs ([5511004](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/551100473e5616234a96770091d236da81c45c41))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The a11y source-discipline test bans window.confirm/alert (design-system Don'ts); the bundle-files delete used window.confirm and the new-file / fork-slug flows used window.prompt — reddening main's Tests check on the previous commit. Delete now goes through useConfirm(); the text prompts through a new promise-based usePromptText() hook (styled Dialog + Input, validation, Enter-to-submit), mirroring useConfirm's shape.
