## [3.122.3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.122.2...v3.122.3) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **secrets,runner:** a codex forfait refreshes itself, and an unrefreshable one stops being silent ([#977](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/977)) ([bf05b07](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/bf05b07dd1d85a5fb14a1ab792c7fe0b071918c6))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Nothing refreshed the ChatGPT (codex) forfait. The server's worker skipped the kind outright when no client id was configured, and the runner's per-run refresher handled only Anthropic, "left to the CLI / store worker" — which was in turn skipping it. Measured on a real deployment: a forfait last refreshed on 2026-08-29 was still being served on 2026-09-08, and the only symptom was a run failing its first LLM call with `401 Provided authentication token is expired`, ten days and one layer away…

## [3.122.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.122.1...v3.122.2) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** a team-scoped write must land in the PATH team, not the caller's tenant ([#997](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/997)) ([#1003](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1003)) ([d6d1fe7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d6d1fe7d7db6ff7bea85e2604b342e692034465b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The auth middleware stamps ONE tenant — the caller's JWT — while authorization is checked against the team in the path, and canManageTeam deliberately admits a super-admin (or an org admin) on a team that is not their active one. When a handler forgot to re-scope, the row landed as (scope_team = path team, tenant_id = caller's team): invisible from both list endpoints, invisible to the target team's runs, and answered 201. The bot then ran without the credential it had been given.

## [3.122.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.122.0...v3.122.1) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **runner:** a new generation erased the checkpoint it should have read ([#990](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/990)) ([6f3926e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6f3926e1aeb2c663cbc32e76f898b62845ad361e)), references [#988](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/988)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The workspace checkpoint is force-pushed to ONE ref per run, so the first push of a new runner generation destroys what the previous one left. That is harmless when the resume continued the same tree, and irreversible when it did not.

## [3.122.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.5...v3.122.0) (2026-09-08)

### Features

* **runs:** expose persisted workspace checkpoint recovery ([#988](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/988)) ([e4a7f60](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e4a7f60f8a92502db5146654c3552958393ce710)), closes [#972](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/972)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Surface the latest successful checkpoint event in inspection and unavailable commit listings, with provenance and a quoted fetch hint. Preserve no_baseline, final-bank fields and merge eligibility; report read failures and require validation of recovered work. Closes #972.

    </details>

## [3.121.5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.4...v3.121.5) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **test:** persist Git fixture maintenance opt-outs ([#987](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/987)) ([1b79f49](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1b79f497d4af062cd21237165fe009198d60da05)), closes [#974](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/974)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Production Git commands invoked by tests do not inherit gittest.Cmd flags. Persist both opt-outs in the fixture common config and verify real Git resolution from source and linked worktrees, keeping a separate command-level control. Fixes #974.

    </details>

## [3.121.4](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.3...v3.121.4) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **sandbox:** a custom workdir over an oversized recipe streams the script, not a wrapper that re-embeds it ([#967](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/967)) ([ac7b8d2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ac7b8d2d83a3bf000cd6cd28b48bdac90ad508c7))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Addresses R6a7f93. The custom-workdir path streamed `cd '<dir>' && exec bash -c '<script>'` through `sh -s`. That keeps the script off the HOST argv, but the in-pod shell then re-issues execve("bash", ["bash", "-c", "<script>"]) — and MAX_ARG_STRLEN applies to that exec too. E2BIG was relocated into the pod, not removed, for precisely the shape this streaming exists to serve: an oversized `<shell> -c <script>` combined with a non-default WorkDir.

## [3.121.3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.2...v3.121.3) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master,modernize:** an extension is acted by the net's subbot only — the gate knows it by the subbot's commits and certified blobs ([#882](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/882)) ([e46e357](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e46e357cc46f171d36a7b14c80b5176061d4c105))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on a live campaign: a lot filed an extension request in one commit and acted it in the next — added the reference, appended the act block — and the harness's provenance rule, which refuses a request and an act introduced by the SAME commit, saw nothing; the lot's own file became a reference of the net that judges it, exempted as a pure addition, and the lot landed with a caveat.

    </details>

## [3.121.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.1...v3.121.2) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** the reads that DESCRIBE a bot resolve the tier that runs it ([#946](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/946)) ([#971](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/971)) ([8608ae5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8608ae5c13429af7bd4bdaa05a0b9185c0e04e21)), references [#871](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/871)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    #871 made every launch surface resolve `team -> platform -> baked`, so a team's fork now runs on its board cards, triggers, schedules and webhooks. The reads that describe those launches stayed on platform-over-baked, so the same delivery ran the fork and was described by the origin — with no diagnostic, because both answers are well-formed.

    </details>

## [3.121.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.121.0...v3.121.1) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* distinguish human waits from stalled runs ([#965](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/965)) ([2bea34b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2bea34b56a7dfbd53736a166fc066f318f0ff352))
* **model:** an in-process retry resumes the session the dead attempt opened ([#958](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/958)) ([f713312](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f713312888a9af206507e4d4a65c52ea1ed21d68)), references [#952](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/952) [#912](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/912)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    When the LAST in-place attempt is the cheap one, the node reported the cost of nothing: attempt 1 spends an agentic session and hits a transient wall, attempt 2 cannot even spawn and returns an empty Result, and `result, err = fn()` overwrote the figure with zero. The caps, the org monthly cap and a lending donor's ledger all read that figure.

    </details>

## [3.121.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.120.2...v3.121.0) (2026-09-08)

### Features

* **observability:** a node served through a facade says so on the run record ([#926](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/926)) ([b3f7efb](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b3f7efb5cc282f7ae7a169b0dff720e0717a1232)), references [#474](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/474)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    With a tenant z.ai key, the claude_code delegate's default precedence routes every node through the Anthropic-shaped facade, which answers the requested claude id with the model it aliases it to. Declared and effective ids agree, model_drift stays silent, and the only trace was the _session_fingerprint buried in the node output. Measured 2026-09-07: three claude_code probe nodes declared claude-fable-5 / claude-opus-5 / claude-opus-4-8 all carried `facade:https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` and…

### Bug Fixes

* **claw:** a stale codex-cli never downgrades the ChatGPT identity, and a JSON Schema type array parses (claw b6e34a39) ([#917](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/917)) ([34ea228](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/34ea228453fa18a0dc6f4ca50989088133e2018a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The ChatGPT-Codex backend gates model availability on the `version:` header; iterion resolved it from a host `codex --version` probe and let that value win over claw's baked release. A stale binary in an image then downgraded every OAuth call: measured 2026-09-07 on the cloud runner (codex-cli 0.139.0 shipped in the image), the backend answered "The 'gpt-6-astra' model requires a newer version of Codex" while the same model is served to the 0.144.6 release claw now presents.

    </details>
* **runview:** list a run's artifacts from its artifact_index when the directory is not on this host ([#919](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/919)) ([7bf70d8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7bf70d84f2a7b99e3d0cf9788767e8ab46e1e88b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ListAllArtifacts walked runs/<id>/artifacts on the local filesystem and returned an empty list when the directory was absent — which is every run on a cloud server pod, since the directory lives on the runner that wrote it. Measured 2026-09-07: a run whose events carried two artifact_written entries (one of them a `publish:`) answered `{"artifacts": []}` on GET /api/runs/{id}/artifacts while GET /api/runs/{id}/artifacts/{node}/0 served the body.

    </details>
* **server:** a launch field the request does not declare is refused, not dropped ([#949](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/949)) ([5ff01b3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5ff01b3b5aad85015843aec2732b7dce1eca2c25))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    From the client, a parameter that was refused and one that was swallowed are the same answer: the request is accepted, the value does nothing, and the caller learns it from the behaviour of whatever it started rather than from what it was told.

    </details>

## [3.120.2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.120.1...v3.120.2) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a queued raise_budget must reach the boundary that is about to kill the run ([#938](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/938)) ([62829f3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/62829f31f41f55be3af0d3e0500ca90bf8c4d204))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `POST /runs/{id}/raise-budget` on a run busy inside a long node answers "queued … the run is busy in a long node and will apply it at its next boundary — it is not lost". For `bump_loop` that is true. For the budget it was false in the one case the command exists for.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** a tool recipe too large for one argv element streams through stdin on kubernetes too ([#937](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/937)) ([03370e7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/03370e74871314eccfc44a3519b4952ceb2fedf4))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The kubernetes driver passed a `sh -c <script>` recipe to `kubectl exec` as a single argv element. Linux caps ONE argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (32 pages = 128 KiB) — a limit no ulimit raises — so a large interpolated recipe fails the fork with E2BIG before the pod is ever contacted:

## [3.120.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.120.0...v3.120.1) (2026-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** a delegation that died still names the session it opened ([#952](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/952)) ([50d6574](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/50d6574b40f8ed38fc9a92169754d5309fcb98ba))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The claude CLI announces its session id on `system/init`, the first thing it emits. It was logged there and dropped. A session that then dies mid-stream never produces a ResultMessage, and the failure path builds its result from that message alone — so the delegate returned a failure that could not name the session it had just spent minutes or hours filling.

## [3.120.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.119.0...v3.120.0) (2026-09-08)

### Features

* **credentials:** accept a bare Claude setup token, and fingerprint the token ([#948](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/948)) ([78b1957](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/78b195794f20bab9b857e5537c733441bff52256))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Three things a session paid for this morning, none of which the existing runbook answered.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **platform-bots:** four defects inside the shadow guard, found after [#851](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/851) merged ([#944](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/944)) ([7ad9695](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7ad9695b5291626ccf161f80df65a3b753e23971))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    warnIfOverrideShadowsNewerBake fires for both origins — storedLaunchBot calls it for `team` rows as well as `platform` ones, and versionsBelow has a dedicated team branch — but the remedy baked into the message was unconditionally the platform one: `iterion remote admin bots push bots/<slug>` and `DELETE /api/admin/bots/<slug>`.

## [3.119.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.118.1...v3.119.0) (2026-09-08)

### Features

* **pipelines:** Retry from zero — a board action that forces a FRESH run ([#954](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/954)) ([27efc84](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/27efc84c82703b9d97c0b3fceef73e8457a32cfc)), closes [#496](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/496) [#494](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/494), references [#495](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/495)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    On a needs-attention card, Retry only restages the ticket and lets whoever claims it decide what "retry" meant: the studio's admission loop mints a fresh run, a live `iterion dispatch` resolves `last_run_id` and RESUMES the dead one from its checkpoint (resolveRunID -> LastRunForIssue -> resumableRunID). So on a dispatcher-owned board Retry is effectively *Resume* — beside a menu that already offers "Resume from checkpoint" as a separate, deliberate action. For a run that died in a way resuming…

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** cancel a node's whole process group, not just its shell ([#935](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/935)) ([#955](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/955)) ([cd3a01b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cd3a01ba6f460e96ebc8b2e6641b4883c7799a54))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A tool node runs its recipe through `exec.CommandContext(ctx, "bash", "-c", …)` without Setpgid, so cancellation killed the shell and nothing else. A job the recipe backgrounded survived, kept the inherited stdout pipe open, and `cmd.Output()` never returned: the run reported cancelled while the work it paid for ran to completion — burning wall-clock, a cloud pod, and writing the workspace that finalization was about to capture.

    </details>
* **server:** a team's forked bot serves every launch surface, not only the manual one ([#940](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/940)) ([6f8bcf1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6f8bcf163980bc9b0206a5fc1e1cdd361555e89a)), closes [#871](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/871), references [#871](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/871) [#946](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/946)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `resolveBotSource` — the chokepoint the board dispatcher, the trigger spine, the cloud scheduler and the inbound webhooks all cross — hardcoded an empty team id, so the team tier of `team -> platform -> baked` applied on the studio button alone. A team that forked a catalog bot in the studio editor ran its fork by hand and the baked/platform bundle on every board card, trigger, schedule and webhook review, with no diagnostic: documented as functional while inert.

### Bug Fixes

* **runner:** reserve the last usage-window retry for the authoritative reset ([#922](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/922)) ([#953](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/953)) ([4e74590](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4e74590f2440e43e412a54ebac0dbf1ece605cb9)), references [#684](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/684) [#684](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/684)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A usage-window retry arms on the EARLIER of the failed credential's own reset and the reopening of a credential the launch's walk passed over (#684). That earlier wake is speculative — the skipped credential may be refused too — yet it spends an attempt of the same budget: every arming `$inc`s `retry_state.attempts` and `ScheduleRunRetry` refuses past `max_attempts`.

## [3.118.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.117.0...v3.118.0) (2026-09-08)

### Features

* **golden-master:** an upload is a multipart request, and its boundary does not move ([#902](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/902)) ([1921402](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/192140260ac4f5af3c19874154f5e09018feaed9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A corpus that declares a file field had it flattened by `urlencode`, which serialises a structured value through its repr: the application received a form field whose value was the TEXT of a Python object, refused the request for the wrong reason, and the reference recorded THAT refusal as the behaviour. An observation point that cannot express its own request observes nothing — and the lot that needed one stopped, correctly, rather than record two rejections as if they were the product.

### Bug Fixes

* **sandbox:** export the seeded forfait config dirs on the container env ([#915](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/915)) ([167c40b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/167c40bb76cf243bb35b1cefda2e20f86a865195))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The run's Claude Code / Codex forfait is delivered into the sandbox and seeded into CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME after start, but only the claude_code and claw delegates pointed their own spawns at those dirs. Every other process in the container — a tool node, a devbox script, a scanner driving the claude-agent-sdk — inherited the bare container env and ran unauthenticated while the credentials sat next to it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `fork -> a` declared twice on a `fan_out_all` router validated clean and still does: the compiler keeps both edges, the run finishes, nothing says anything. But `fan_out_all` spawns one goroutine per outgoing edge and derives every branch id from the TARGET (`branch_<router>_<target>`), so the two executions wear one id — they collapse onto one output slot at convergence and, since durable branch checkpoints, onto one `BranchCheckpoint` whose cursor each goroutine overwrites, which lets a…

### Bug Fixes

* **platform-bots:** a stored override that shadows a newer baked bundle is no longer silent ([#851](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/851)) ([8ce6262](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8ce6262cb59d4c07e4300608bf9cc899beaa684c)), references [#742](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/742) [780/#785](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/785)

    A platform or team bot override outranks the baked catalog at every launch surface — that is the tier's purpose. The cost, unmeasured until now, is that a bundle pushed once keeps serving after a later release bakes a newer one for the same slug: the image moves, the bot does not, and nothing says so.

    `AggregateLabels() []LabelUsage` had no error to report a failure with, so boardmongo's only option after a failed `listAll` was `return nil` — and the studio label picker, `iterion remote labels` and every vocabulary consumer read a transient Mongo failure as "this board uses no labels", with an operator re-creating labels that already exist.

One of the two debts got a field when it was measured (`holdout_awaiting_gate`); the other stayed prose.

    A net can declare a second ENVIRONMENT for the same corpus — a second database engine, a second runtime — and judging it means booting the app the other way and replaying the SAME references.

    On a driver whose workspace is a tar COPY inside a pod, nothing a run produces leaves that pod before teardown: the export runs once, at the end, and every push the runner performs reads the exported clone.

    The terminal sink (ADR-096 §5) protects a card from a MACHINE resurrecting it. A drag on the bound GitHub board is not a machine: it is the operator's hand, arriving through the only channel they have.

    ChainHooks composed 18 of the 22 func fields and dropped OnAssistantText, OnUsageCap, OnUsageProgress and OnOrchestrationStall. runview chains every ExtraHooks entry through it, so any run launched with one — the Prometheus exporter (ITERION_PROMETHEUS_ADDR) is the shipped case — lost those four event families silently: no live usage_progress for a supervisor's cost_gt monitor, no usage_cap, no delegate_stall, no assistant text in the timeline.

    Revi's open question on the fourth round: "reverted" let the gate through whenever revert.sh exited 0, even when git status still showed changes; the note said so, nothing stopped, and record mode has no dirty check — an under-specified revert.sh would have references sealed over the residue, the harm the sweep runs in record mode to prevent.

    The early-accept added for #854 is a READ, and the retire it was meant to prevent is decided two syscalls later — nothing serialises them across publishers. Replay with pinned A/B/C over one cache dir: C reads `dest` absent; A renames its tree in; B's rename loses ENOTEMPTY and enters the fallback; C's `os.Stat` now sees A's tree and retires it, so `dest` is ABSENT; B's read finds nothing and returns the ENOTEMPTY cause. The exact message that ejected #822 from the merge queue, still reachable.

* **server,cloudpublisher:** the board dispatcher launches through the org gate, a run no credential tier can fund is refused at publish, and a launch give-up reaches the needs-attention lane ([#850](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/850)) ([0841f18](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0841f182ffac421f535ad017421545ba00a00df2)), closes [#841](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/841)

    A `queued` doc is the one status runResolveDoc restarts from the entry node, so a redelivery that reaches it from an earlier life of the run re-spends everything the checkpoint exists to save. The admission gauntlet now reads the queued arm explicitly: a launch message published before the doc's current QueuedAt belongs to a finished attempt and is dropped (the attempt now queued carries its own delivery), and a queued doc holding a checkpoint resumes instead of restarting.

When the forge refuses to say (a token without the scope, a forge without the field), the unforced apply answered a bare 502 that recorded nothing — so the studio card, which now only offers the vouch on a 409, repeated the identical 502 on every click and the forced apply the server still supports was unreachable from it.

    A sandboxed claw node prices its call inside the container, from a cold process where neither the live registry nor the aggregator has a cache yet, so the committed table is what it falls back to — and gpt-5.6-sol, the model the campaign bots' cross-family plan review runs on, had no entry: 24 of the 33 plan reviews served on ovh-prod in the last week carried no cost_usd at all (#805).

The compiled IR of a server ahead of the fleet does not load on the runner, the error came back generic, and the delivery loop did what it does with generic errors — while the run said nothing.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's gate on #800 (R8b0bd7): giving the apply one bounded context put the outcome record under the same 20 s deadline as the upload — so the slow forge, the failure worth recording, expired the context first and the record never ran (and an upload landing near the deadline answered 502 for an avatar that was live). The record now takes a 10 s budget of its own, detached from the round-trips; a forge that hangs is proved to leave its reason on the connection.

    `model.WithRunID` / `WithTemplateData` were attached on the trunk dispatch path only, so the SAME node rendered two ways depending on how it was reached. Inside a `fan_out_all` / `fan_out_each` body a prompt kept its literal `{{outputs.x.y}}` braces and a tool `command:` substituted an EMPTY string for `{{run.id}}` — a silent constant, not a visible failure. The llm router and the `llm_or_human` LLM half never had the snapshot either.

    The platform pods (server, runner) and the sandboxed run pods carried no PriorityClass, so a run pod bursting on a node committed at 99 % of its requests was a peer of the runner that owns its run for the scheduler and for eviction. `server.priorityClassName` / `runner.priorityClassName` (empty = the cluster default) let a deployment rank the platform above the run pods it starts (SocialGouv/iterion#732: prod sets both to the cluster's `resource-burstable`; the run pods stay unclassed).

Measured on a run whose repair loop was declined with remaining 15 644 s and needed 13 154 s: used 13 156 + needed 13 154 = 26 310 ≥ 25 920 (90 % of 28 800). The event…

    Revi's gate on #794: the runbook handed the PIC operator the non-forced avatar command for connections that predate AccountKind — every one of them answered 409 needs_force, because the field is written at connect time only. The apply now asks the forge who the token is when the field is empty and records what it learns, so the bot gate judges the account and a group-token bot user needs no --force; a person's PAT still does.

    The loop budget guard prices the next iteration by the last one, from a mark set when the loop is entered from outside. That mark was only set when the body was entered at the loop's HEAD (loop.Entries). A campaign bot's extension loop is entered elsewhere: its body shares the verify and gate nodes with the lot's own repair loop, so the run reaches it at verify, off its head, and the loop kept the mark the session baseline had set at run start. Its first crossing was then priced at everything…

    branch-improve-loop's plan-phase guard measured its own wall clock in `plan_scope_probe` (a `started_epoch` stamp) and compared spend against two vars mirroring the `budget:` block by hand. Both were workarounds for primitives that did not exist; both are now defects. A mirror var is not reached by `iterion run --max-cost-usd 200`, so a re-budgeted run kept refusing against the literal 75 nobody had updated — the guard's arithmetic silently disagreeing with the budget the run was actually under.

    AGENTS.md makes the Projects v2 board the roadmap truth and the native board the bots' operational surface, but nothing joins them: the board's Status/Area/Mode/Priority live in the GraphQL API, and no seam in iterion speaks GraphQL to a forge. So a human's "In progress" never reaches the dispatcher and a bot's "done" never reaches the roadmap.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `containsClawNode` read each node's declared `backend:` and `fallbacks:` only. Launch-time model/backend overrides (`--backend '*=claw'`, `--model`, the studio override object, `RunMessage.model_overrides`) are applied at dispatch and never folded into the IR, so a workflow of `claude_code` nodes run with `--backend '*=claw'` got no in-container iterion binary: every node died on `exec: /usr/local/bin/iterion: no such file or directory`, and `sandbox_claw_routed_via_runner` stayed silent.

    A fresh client's first server selection can outlast a single 5 s ping on a loaded host while the replica set is healthy — the handshake is late, not the primary absent.

Adds the MR-scoped counterpart posting to /merge_requests/:iid/notes, needed by the upcoming GitLab /revi approve reply lane.

    The three refresh paths did Get -> RefreshRecord -> whole-record Upsert, so a rename committed between the read and the persist was reverted to the label the refresh had read a provider round trip earlier. The rename side was already a store-level $set (SetAccountLabel); this is its mirror.

* **runner:** wire a SubbotRunner into the cloud runner — subbot nodes ran locally only ([#743](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/743)) ([1716b9e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1716b9e266328332bdc5757012da92f544fb61d1))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The pod's engine was built without WithSubbotRunner (pkg/runner/loop.go), while the CLI and the studio paths carried one. Every `subbot` node on a cloud run therefore died at dispatch with `subbot "x": no SubbotRunner is wired` — a net's extension subbot, its re-anchor subbot, and a programme supervisor's per-lot child all existed locally only. "No feature ships local-only", violated by the one surface that runs unattended.

    Two production runs on iterion#683 spent the whole planning chain (plan -> plan_review -> plan_revise) for 150 min / $8.59 combined and never reached campaign, the node that writes code (native:695). The chain had no ceiling of its own, so it could freely spend the entire run's max_duration / max_cost_usd budget on an optional enrichment (ADR-091) before the actual delivery work ever started.

* **golden-master:** an extension act already present at base is not re-judged ([#735](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/735)) ([292e3f6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/292e3f65a577a46b05096ebc7f14aa02e1950726))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    extension_verdict judged EVERY act in the ledger at HEAD against the run's base. An act introduced before that base has, by construction, its added references in the base tree — so every one of them read as "existed at base — a rewrite wearing an addition's name", and the certifier refused a net that had done nothing wrong.

    A reading carrying a reset instant was trusted until that instant, however old. The provider resets windows early: on 2026-09-04 the ledger held 93-99% seven_day readings taken before such a reset, every credential walk skipped both forfaits on them and every claude_code run was refused at admission — the revi/review gate of two PRs with them — for a reset four days out.

### Features

* **sandbox/kubernetes:** run pods carry resource requests and a soft node spread ([#694](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/694)) ([8243001](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8243001d56d18f00bc85ef8569f765e54c73384c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A sibling pod that requests nothing scores every node the same, so the scheduler packs a campaign's runs onto whichever node already holds the sandbox image. Measured on a three-worker pool (8 cores each): five of six run pods on one node at 89% CPU while two workers idled, and a behavioural oracle's 300 s application boot budget blown at 459 s — red verdicts on untouched trees, one run burning its 8 h budget on that red.

    syncSchedules rebuilds an integration's schedule rows from the manifests on every re-provision and carried cron, pause and guard tuning over — but not the vars the operator set, nor last_fire_at, and it minted a new id each time.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Nothing on an OAuth record said WHOSE account it was. The payload is sealed, the API view exposed neither a label nor the fingerprint, and the only place the credential is ever identified is a server log line the publisher writes when it picks one (fp=700acc7b…). Answering "whose subscription paid for that run?" therefore meant grepping logs and correlating hex by hand — measured today, with three fingerprints across three owners in one window.

    Two lines apart, expandWildcards hard-fails a wildcard whose MCP server cannot boot and merely warns when that server booted with no tools. The asymmetry is correct — #633 established that ambient servers (target repo .mcp.json, plugin catalog) degrade per-server upstream in buildTask, so a wildcard reaching this function is a DECLARED dependency and must never be dropped in silence — but nothing at the code site said so, and the error named neither the declaration nor a way out.

    The codex CLI hard-errors on any non-noop sandbox driver at dispatch — so a codex stage on a sandboxed node fails EXACTLY when the fallback chain is needed, which is worse than not having it. ApplyRunFallback now resolves each node's effective sandbox mode (node override → workflow spec → the deployment's ITERION_SANDBOX_DEFAULT snapshot, threaded through ExecutorSpec from both the cloud runner and the local service) and refuses the stage with the same launch-time voice as the other C176…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The refresh worker only renews connections expiring within Lead (was 5m), swept every 10m: a 1h installation token could go from "not yet due" to "expired" between two ticks, the refresh then landing AT expiry — and since each mint inherits that phase, the connection locks onto an always-refreshed-at-death cycle. Any run whose launch minute sits just before the lock point is sealed a token with seconds of life: its clone barely makes it, its state push and NATS redeliveries die on it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A provider that freezes an account for 'usage pattern' violations publishes NO numeric bound to adapt to: the refusal message names no frequency, the 200s carry no rate headers, and the threshold only reveals itself by tripping it — which is how a whole fleet ended up frozen behind one credential.

### Features

* **usagecap:** an auth-rejected credential becomes skip evidence — the third refusal family ([#624](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/624)) ([b7f2ef0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b7f2ef00eccb51a84ac49a3c414504907a49c154))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Re-resolution is already universal server-side (SubmitResume and the retry sweeper both re-resolve), yet a structurally-broken credential kept condemning run after run: it filled its slot on every resolution, gated the pool and platform tiers off, and its failure produced NO evidence for the credential-tier skip to act on. Quota refusals have a family, frequency refusals have a family — the provider rejecting the credential ITSELF had none.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Completes the credential chain the fair-usage freeze exposed: the BYOK tier resolved ONE fixed key per provider, so a key whose account the provider froze was resealed into every fresh launch until an operator removed it by hand (measured 2026-09-02: two removals, five cancels, three relaunch waves).

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** a fair-usage refusal parks the run and feeds the credential skip — not the node's answer ([#610](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/610)) ([dade12e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/dade12e7626a94ee8af8c7a103470711f5afe27e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured 2026-09-02: a provider account under a fair-usage frequency restriction refused EVERY request with a ~330-char relayed 429. The one-liner length cap kept isRateLimitMessage from seeing it, so the refusal text became the agent's output (a campaign node 'finished' with the error as its work_remaining); two modernize lots burned ~7h each overnight and two rites spun full passes on it in minutes.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The tiers were a fixed first choice, not a chain: a run whose tenant (or the platform) holds an OAuth forfait was never eligible for any later tier, INCLUDING when that forfait's provider window was closed. The run got the exhausted credential, spent one LLM call to be refused, and parked until the window reset - up to a week on the weekly one - while a second forfait or the mutualised pool could have served it immediately.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    TestBudgetGraceCoversDuration slept 350ms against a 570ms graced ceiling, leaving ~220ms for engine overhead — a loaded CI runner spends more than that and the run correctly dies past the ceiling, failing the test (seen ejecting merge-queue entries).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The measured class, one campaign, 48h: a converged run waited 8h51 for a human; a run marked 'handled' by its external observer was redelivered, worked 6h, converged, and was never looked at again; a third landed while carrying an explicit blocker and reddened every downstream launch. The decision lived outside the authority that knows the state — an external script guessing from a stale copy.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An operator who pins gate_enabled=false on a repo integration turns the review bot advisory-only — no commit status ever lands — so the statuses-scope derivation that forces re-review-on-sync (whose sole purpose is keeping a REQUIRED check alive across pushes) no longer applies. The pin now disables the forcing on fresh provisions AND releases an already-forced sync through the backfill, in both cases surviving re-provisions — unlike a bare review_on_sync PATCH, which the next provision…

    An authenticated identity whose TeamID resolved empty (a PAT minted with no team whose owner has no default team, a GitHub-gated user before any grant) sailed through requireAuth and reached the Mongo store with an EMPTY tenant in ctx — the store's fail-closed guard then panicked on every request: a recovered 500 for the caller, steady-state Sentry noise burying real crashes (ITERION-13/-1W/-1Z, 1800+ events since 2026-08-24 on GET /api/runs, GET /api/runs/{id} and the run WebSocket).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    'converged + nothing blocking' has no generic representation: outputs are an opaque per-bot bag, and a consumer reading only a convergence flag would have auto-landed exactly the blocked run a measured incident came from (a converged branch carrying an explicit blocker — 190 min of downstream work reddened).

* **server:** a queued run waiting for a free runner is not an orphan ([#602](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/602)) ([a6d6fb9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a6d6fb987901c3fe9b808ca59b8b3890df243268))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The orphan sweeper reads "queued row, stale, no lease" as "the message is gone" and flips the run to failed_resumable. That is one of TWO causes with the same shape, and the other one is normal operation: a runner pod takes ONE run at a time, so a frozen pool is a hard parallelism ceiling — a campaign of multi-hour runs fills every pod and short runs simply wait their turn, unfetched, lease-less, and stale.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run document that says failed_resumable and nothing else forces every outcome consumer to guess: is a redelivery in flight? did it hit its budget wall? was it an operator stop? Measured on a live campaign: a budget wall hidden behind an empty final_error (the code existed — in the run_failed EVENT, never on the document), and an external router that marked a redelivered run 'handled' while it quietly converged.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The dispatcher resumed `cancelled` runs from their checkpoint (bilan issue-triage friction 7): an operator's cancel was undone on the next tick. The status was in the auto-resume set because the dispatcher's OWN stops (stall reap, external state change, daemon shutdown) used a bare context.CancelFunc, so the engine persisted `cancelled` for them too — removing the status alone would have turned stall recovery into a permanent park.

    A sandboxed claw node with an enabled permission gate was refused outright: delegate.IOTask carried no policy, so the in-container __claw-runner would have executed bash/file_edit/write_file ungated.

* **gate:** the sweep's last pass over a stuck run must be visible at info ([#577](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/577)) ([f416cbc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f416cbcf4a968a2b4ff7b13d8e6d65e3467aa0ab)), references [#564](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/564)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run that owes a merge-gate verdict and abstains logs its reason at Debug on the sweep path, to keep ~60 identical lines an hour per replica out of the log. Deployments run at info, so those passes emitted nothing at all: the single Warn the event path fires dies with the pod, and a required check left unanswered has no trace anywhere naming why.

### Features

* **queue:** the run-level fallback route rides the wire to the pod ([#574](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/574)) ([d51fd5d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d51fd5da08e7c40ea5acc758e259e642515cd017)), references [#513](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/513)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The launch API accepted `fallback` (the operator's single run-level rescue route, ADR-087) and the local executor honoured it — but the cloud publisher dropped it at publish: no RunMessage field, no run-doc stamp, no resume replay. The route meant to rescue a run from a provider's exhausted usage window never fired precisely where runs park unattended (measured on one campaign: 72-85% of two runs' wall-clock lost to usage-window parking a declared fallback would have bypassed).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The aggregator has parsed and cached limit.output since ADR-042, but the field stopped at fetchedSpec: nothing downstream could read a model's completion cap. Carry it through merge onto ModelCapabilities, out via ResolvedCapabilities, and into the `iterion models` table as a MAX OUT column.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A digest over 14000 chars was truncated with a notice pointing at "the run artifacts" — somewhere its chat readers cannot go. The 28 août Veille Cyber digest (14803 chars) lost its last 803 characters that way.

* **runner:** a dying run banks its branch ([#556](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/556)) ([5d2007f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5d2007f87a2481e082f2ce2d4b45ec1d59294aa4))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A repo-targeted cloud run that died (budget cap mid-delegate, failure path) left its commits only in the git-meta snapshot: the bank push was gated on runErr == nil, so the branch never reached the forge and the successor restarted from the base commit. Turning the snapshot back into a branch took a manual replay every time — measured: nine manual recoveries in three days of one campaign.

### Bug Fixes

* **feed-watch:** size the marker reserve from the marker, and refuse the queue on a truncated digest ([#576](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/576)) ([73fdf0c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/73fdf0c096831b85c4e84f64442f5a9d2b126054))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    R79a75e. MARK_RESERVE was 32 while the truncation notice the last capped part carries is 64 chars, so a ceiling-truncated digest overshot the very budget the reserve exists to respect: at limit=1200 the last message measured 1232. An operator who sets a sink's max_chars to the platform's own limit gets that POST rejected — losing precisely the notice saying the digest was cut.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Bots parameterize their model pins, reasoning effort and tunables as ${ITERION_X:-default} expansions, read from the runner pod's env — so re-tuning a bot meant a Helm values change and a rollout, while credentials, bundles, caps, roles and the sandbox image had all moved to the CLI→API→DB settings surface. Same doctrine, fourth family: bot_vars.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The sandbox image ships no codex binary, so with no ITERION_CODEX_VERSION override the in-container runner fell back to claw's baked-in version string and OpenAI 400'd newer models (gpt-5.6-sol) that the host's own codex install can serve. Forward the host-resolved version through the existing env choke point.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The flow that had never run for real now has: two watch-only GitHub Apps (one per org, since a private App only installs on its owner), both on All repositories, both carrying metadata+vulnerability_alerts read and nothing else. `poll_dependabot` answered `orgs_ok: 2, orgs_failed: 0` — which is the proof that the dependabot_tokens map is keyed by ORG and not by the App's bot handle, the critical the review caught and no test could see.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    SubmitLaunch published the operator's budget override on the wire, but SubmitResume rebuilt its RunMessage with a nil override — so the first usage-window auto-retry silently reverted the run to the workflow's own cap. Measured: a run launched with max_duration 8h, parked by a cap and resumed, died at 14407s/14400s while its doc still displayed 8h. Cloud resumes are unattended, so nothing could re-state the ask.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The ChatGPT-forfait wire gates model availability on the codex-cli version header. The sandbox image ships no codex binary, so the in-container runner's `codex --version` probe finds nothing and falls back to claw's baked-in version — which the backend refuses for newer models. Lived on iterion#541's /billy run: plan_review 400'd with "gpt-5.6-sol requires a newer codex-cli" on every cloud attempt, with no operator-side cure since the override never crossed the boundary.

    A usage reading records which WINDOW is spent, keyed by backend and scope (tenant/platform). When the credential behind that slot is rotated — a fresh OAuth token posted over a team's exhausted one — the old account's seven-day reading stayed on the meter, legitimately fresh until its own reset instant, and parked every run of the new credential for days. Lived on a real deployment: a fresh token blocked at 95% by the reading of the account it replaced, resets five days out.

    A node whose usage takes the run past a hard cap has already SUCCEEDED: its output is validated, persisted and in the store.

    A binary built between releases — or from a release whose sandbox image did not ship — pins ghcr.io/socialgouv/iterion-sandbox-slim:<version>, a tag nobody pushed.

    A YAML scalar and a sequence are both legitimate contract forms for a lot's exit_gate. plan_read joined the value with "\n" unconditionally, so a bare string was iterated character by character: the verifier's first command became the single letter of the declared gate, failed with exit 127, and the lot could never converge — a red verdict manufactured by the reader, not earned by the tree.

    The [high] that motivated `ValidateShellSafeRef` in #508 does not exist. Its premise — that a bot's `PUSH_BRANCH={{vars.push_branch}} python3 -c` reaches the shell unquoted — reads the .bot SOURCE as if it were the final command line. The engine shell-escapes every ref at substitution time (resolveCommandTemplate → shellEscapeValue), so the hostile value arrives as `PUSH_BRANCH='x;id;#'`. Proven by execution, with the shell itself as the oracle.

    A cloud launch's model_overrides were persisted display-only: the studio showed the operator's per-node pins, but the RunMessage never carried them and the runner pod built its executor without them — every delegate ran on the workflow's own models while the Overview claimed otherwise.

    The CLI decoded /api/auth/me with a hand-mirrored struct whose flat `teams` field the server had re-nested under orgs[].teams: every field silently zeroed, so `teams switch` refused every team as 'not a member', `orgs switch` accepted only the already-active org, `orgs list` showed a single org, and `teams list` rendered an all-empty table with every row starred (wrong json tags on the same wire).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An export-based sandbox (kubernetes) hands the runner a COPY of the pod workspace. When that copy arrives stale or empty, the host clone reads exactly like a run that made no commits, and bankRepoWorkspace concluded 'nothing to bank' — a silent total loss of a finished run's work (run 01a02a4b: gate converged citing its commit hashes, FinalBranch empty, zero commits recorded).

    Adversarial review of the banking invariant found a reproducible false refusal: tar cannot delete, so when a pod-side `git gc` / `pack-refs --all --prune` moves a ref into packed-refs, the export overlay leaves the host's pre-run LOOSE ref in place — and git resolves loose before packed, so the exported clone reads a pre-run HEAD while every object actually arrived.

## [3.53.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.52.0...v3.53.0) (2026-08-20)

### Features

* **health:** the probes echo the usage-cap policy — an unobservable guard cannot be trusted ([a984b10](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a984b1066ad212f0f6868e74a34df5695d13d13c))
* **probes:** a lame-duck window, so a deploy stops refusing live connections ([#467](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/467)) ([d98af76](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d98af765e87491e6a98f55d02fa454c889ebd99c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    On SIGTERM the server went straight to Shutdown. Endpoint removal is asynchronous, so for the 1-10s it takes to propagate, the listener was already closed while traffic was still routed here — a connection-refused: a 502 in the studio, a dropped delivery for a forge webhook. With server.hpa enabled by default that happened on every scale-down, not just on deploys.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** ship a ready JVM truststore beside the egress CA — six ecosystems read the CA env vars, a JVM reads none ([4ad6768](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4ad6768334b4521c772913190224afabbdec41d0))

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** the CLI's no-credential render is an auth failure, not an answer ([e7a721e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e7a721e5e4d382cdaa276b9f614d8c37942abe9d))

## [3.52.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.51.1...v3.52.0) (2026-08-20)

### Features

* **platform-creds:** DB-backed platform LLM credentials — rotate the fallback without a redeploy ([#466](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/466)) ([ecea9d5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ecea9d5574709c122aacc9ba05af48448ed7d049))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The credential a tenant-less run inherits — historically the runner pod's env (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from the iterion-forfait k8s secret, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY et al.) — can now live sealed in Mongo, managed by super-admins and rotated with one call that every new launch AND resume picks up (SubmitResume re-resolves credentials). The env stays as the final backstop: an empty platform store keeps today's behaviour byte-identical.

    Revi's post-merge advisory on #463, verified red-first: sentry.StartSpan installs the new span on the hub's scope (tracing.go:210) and doFinish only restores the previous span for NON-transactions (tracing.go:472) — so StartIndependent on the process-global hub left its finished llm.generate transaction on the global scope forever, and every later captured error/panic inherited that unrelated trace context (reproduced: the regression test failed on the exact trace_id match before the fix).

## [3.51.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.50.2...v3.51.0) (2026-08-20)

### Features

* **golden-master:** standard 3 — the net states its FEATURES, not only its routes ([7b04458](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7b04458ce937c58bf306cb1a0a36774494e7cd01))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A route the corpus touches once is not a feature it exercises. A net declaring standard 3 must ship a feature_probe (two independent witnesses: the served navigation graph and the tree's own catalogues) and a committed feature-coverage.json mapping every feature to corpus entries or excluding it in writing. The gate refuses unmapped, stale and broken-evidence inventories by name; existing nets keep their declared standard, and the verdict carries the figure so a below-standard net is visible,…

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the seal opt-in becomes committable — config.json's seal_committed, auditable like the rest ([d8ee9ef](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d8ee9ef72d7ef563fb7bf54451d7463ed2d55ec3))
* **modernize:** defect disposition — fixed and recorded by default, preserved only by written business decision ([8af1388](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8af13882835620afb2613ed50b82bf964ae2dd37))
* **modernize:** outcomes — what the programme owes becomes a conjunction term of its convergence ([f0e5332](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f0e53329ea66662cd50339aece73f867ad72fa61))
* **observability:** opt-in Sentry tracing — API transactions + LLM-call spans (Obsy dogfood) ([#463](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/463)) ([39ebe8a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/39ebe8aa7adc8845d22a9f23bf5b04cec130fcbe))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Tracing rides the SAME client and DSN as error tracking; sentry-go does not read SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE on its own, so Init resolves it and sets EnableTracing/TracesSampleRate. Unset, 0, unparsable or out of [0,1] ⇒ strictly off even with a DSN — and the refusal is loud, but never costs error tracking. NaN is rejected explicitly: it fails every ordered comparison, so the naive range check would let it through.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master,modernize:** the adversarial review's findings — a ratchet for the standard, named refusals everywhere, and skills that say exactly what is checked ([a6d5b8f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a6d5b8f46589e50c79b8d77057de4fb7f3eb4f46))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    H2: standard-mark makes a silent 3->2 downgrade a named refusal in both drift directions. M2/M3: malformed feature-coverage and mistyped seal opt-ins bail with their cause instead of a traceback or a silence. M1: holdout_awaiting_gate is a report field, not only a notice. H1/C1/B2: the skills now state exactly what the harness checks (union-level source labels), where the outcomes conjunction is enforced today (the campaign runner, not this graph — roadmap named), and that SSR stacks DO expose…

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a gate never seals a COMMITTED held-out set — it awaits its own gate ([26bd79a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/26bd79a0798b6b0e953052a73492798158da0166))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The seal moves the set out of the tree, which strips TRACKED files when the set was committed by an earlier authoring run: the finalize then refuses the dirty tree, and the set's single scoring burns on a gate that does not own it. A committed set is now left in place and noted; the convergence gate that owns it opts in explicitly with GM_SEAL_COMMITTED=1 — a flag that can only widen what the gate consumes, never soften a verdict. Selftest 45 -> 48.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** round-2 adversarial findings — every refusal named, in every type ([703cd81](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/703cd8183348267aaed385ee5591d2646f57ed9d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Non-string reasons and feature ids, unreadable standard-marks, mistyped GM_SEAL_COMMITTED spellings, valid-JSON-non-object ledger blocks: each was a traceback or a silence, each is now a named refusal. A feature mapped twice or both mapped and excluded refuses (nobody chose). A mid-path ** in a route pattern refuses (the doctrine says a tail). The standard-raise doctrine now states the PAIRED-commit rule the code enforces. Selftest 57 -> 66.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** round-3 findings — the refusal envelope survives every path ([b99964f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b99964fad5e6d251c39827d47792099ab3756097))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A ledger block that is a dict without a string id escalates as UNPARSEABLE instead of a KeyError two functions later; the seal opt-in refusal reaches the supervisor through bail()'s JSON envelope like every other refusal; a feature excluded twice refuses (two reasons, nobody chose). No false-green found this round. Selftest 66 -> 68.

    </details>
* **modernize:** the boolean-attribute probe becomes mechanical — rendered DOM, anchors included ([4ad6952](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4ad6952197ea02b005f415561090c7c7933462fc))
* **modernize:** the judge's INPUTS are immutable too — a corpus can be amputated in silence ([fb4a453](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fb4a453d5b089fbe902df26c21a8cb19b72336e5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Narrowing corpus.json, or widening the coverage exclusions, shrinks what the net measures without moving one reference — and a green cannot report that shrinkage. The immutability check now covers what decides the verdict in all three families: the references compared, the machinery comparing them, and the inputs saying what to measure. Paths are quoted.

    </details>
* **modernize:** the judge's own machinery is as immutable as its references ([9f6ed9a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9f6ed9ac861504f59d643572c6fea68c5a50471e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A lot that rewrites verify-oracle.sh or harness.py makes every later gate answer green without measuring anything, and no reference moves — measured as a real gap. refs_untouched now diffs the runner, the harness and the canonicaliser alongside refs/.

    The bare `!third_party/codex-agent-sdk-go/.claude/` negation re-included the WHOLE subtree, not just the fork's committed `rules/`: the root-anchored `.claude/skills/` rule on line 145 does not reach that depth, so `…/.claude/skills/JUNK.md` and `…/.claude/settings.local.json` came back as untracked. That is exactly the runtime junk `**/.claude/` exists to stop, and the fork is an active work target whose campaign bots commit with `git add -A`.

    Adds Logger.SetHook: a callback invoked for every record at or above warn with the record's message and a private copy of its inherited fields. The slot is shared across WithField/WithFields forks like the writer and mutex, so a hook installed on the root logger reaches forks made before or after SetHook.

    After a reboot, sweepStaleLocalClaimsAtBoot frees the claim that parked a card whose last run sits on a human node, and resumableRunID excludes paused_waiting_human by design — so the next tick minted a fresh run from the workflow entry, silently superseding the paused one.

    The api-keys store derives tenant_id from the context — on write it stamps the row, on read it filters — and requireAuth stamps the CALLER'S ACTIVE team.

    Two devbox.json files can supply a run's binaries — the bot's own and the target repo's — and until now both installed, always.

A review reads a diff and writes comments; it built nothing, and it paid iterion's own 319 Nix paths, 406 MiB downloaded, 1.8 GiB unpacked, a desktop GUI stack included, before its first node.

    An empty queue makes a digest exit at plan -> load_pending -> done: no LLM, no post, status finished.

* **clean:** the leftover checkouts reclaimed — landing decides, not age ([c116029](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c1160294e56473065907c6864c830aa91b4c7a77))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A `worktree: auto` run that succeeds removes its checkout; one that fails or is interrupted leaves it behind for inspection and never comes back for it. On a long-lived store that pool is where the disk goes, and `runs prune` cannot reach it — its own doc says it never touches worktrees/.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a converged campaign leaves a mergeable tree ([d2bbf23](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d2bbf23e43b3dff6d7fcc4e5c752b8640a586cb3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two sources of end-of-run dirt, each of which forced a human landing: the harness self-copy now materialises ONE canonical form and writes only on change (no more header churn between the standalone and the inlined node), and emit_runner commits its own emissions — runner, report, harness, a bytecode-cache gitignore — scoped to the oracle dir. A landed-by-hand net is where a hardened runner got clobbered once.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a pending re-baseline request blocks the gate ([369f6d3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/369f6d3e33e7286335075ae95c0ed3d3c083ffe5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Four requests sat unacted behind four consecutive green convergences: each one quarantines known-diverging entries out of the verdict, so the gate was green AROUND a narrowing net — the failure this bot exists to catch, one level up. Pending requests are now a conjunction term, parsed from the ledger's machine blocks; supersedence becomes the declared 'replaces' field (prose does not count), and an unparseable block is an escalation, never a guess. Selftest 32 -> 38.

    Fifth pass. It overturns one of the fourth's fixes, which is the honest outcome: what round 4 removed as a false positive was the only thing standing between a self-contained clone and its own destruction.

    Second adversarial pass. The first one's fixes were right and incomplete: what it left open destroyed work, and what it over-refused made the command nearly useless.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The template piped the harness's stderr into the JSON report, so the runner died parsing its own progress messages — a campaign found it, hardened its materialised copy, and the next emission reintroduced the defect from this template. Fixed where it is emitted from.

    Five required corpus probes — a creation, the error-then-corrected journey, a case pair, a text sort, a login case variant — enforced mechanically before boot, exactly like the mutant archetypes: a tag without its shape does not count.

    A major redefines semantics under unchanged lines: routing edge forms, implicit binding conversion, query strictness, template attribute semantics, dialect functions, seed allocator state, collation, and defaults that flip silently.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The sealed pile lived beside the workspace, which assumes a writable parent — a sandboxed run mounts the worktree's parent read-only and the first seal died on it. The default root is now the system temp dir, and the name hashes the absolute workspace path: sibling worktrees of one repo share a basename, and under a common root they would otherwise seal into each other's pile. GM_SEALED_DIR and GM_SCRATCH still override.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ReviewScopePanel and HumanPromptForm shared the same React key as siblings. React's remaining-children map keeps only the last child per key, so Prev/Next unmounted the form and left every previous ReviewScopePanel mounted. A card with dozens of human gates then stacked "No file diff for this review" once per visit.

    Observed on iterion#386 today: a 20-minute verify ended the RUN, not the build. TimeoutExpired was caught and then the handler itself raised — e.output is bytes on the timeout path even though text=True was passed, because the decode happens after communicate() returns normally and a timeout attaches the raw buffer instead. bytes + str is a TypeError, so the operator got failed_resumable and a traceback where a verdict belonged.

    GitLab's AdminClient gains ListCommitStatuses (the CommitStatusLister capability), the read half of the merge gate: without it the gate reconciler must abstain on GitLab — a review that dies leaves the required context absent forever — and the auto-fix lane can never launch, since it refuses to act on a gate it cannot see.

    Three holds on 2026-08-12 reported "build/tests not green" over an excerpt containing nothing but a list of ok lines and a bare FAIL.

* **expr:** concat() is the array builtin — string joins use +, and a guard now says so ([8125c06](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8125c0660f3bc7fd3abf9d368efd5a659dff9303))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A compute expression written concat('prefix: ', outputs.x.log) parses, compiles and validates clean, then dies at evaluation with "want array". It lives in notice/fail_log fields inside if(converged, …, <the concat>) — the FAILURE branch — so it crashes only once something else has already gone wrong, turning a reported failure into a dead run. It had shipped in a bundled subbot's refusal path; a sibling bot hit the same shape on its first real run and exposed the class.

    </details>
* **review-env:** an attached skill is a FILE, not a registry entry ([82b8eff](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/82b8efffba96580dece24df0f9c63afe2cb2073f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    First real run: the plugin mirrored deploy-target.md into the workspace's .claude/skills/, the agent asked the Skill tool for it by name, got "Unknown skill" — that registry carries the bundle's own skills — and correctly refused to deploy. The refusal worked; the premise was wrong. The prompt now names the mirrored PATH as the authority (the pattern app-dev's validated deploy phase already used) and says a missing registry entry is not evidence of a missing skill.

    </details>
* **review-env:** the cluster is the authority on pullability, not an anonymous probe ([e14360c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e14360c211e767f1213e0b979396a4789845534c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two runs refused to deploy a NAMED image because a probe of the private registry answered 401 — a probe the agent was never meant to run: the pull credential lives in the namespace as an operator-provisioned imagePullSecret it cannot read, by design. So it predicted the failure instead of measuring it, and left the only question that matters unanswered. The prompt now says: once you can name the image, apply and let the rollout answer; ImagePullBackOff is a measurement you report.

* **review-env:** the mounted path is the rendered template, not the env var ([e18e9bc](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e18e9bc618ba5d7ac36f4e39b60232ac81211406))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on the first deploying run: a secret's env: declaration is injected into TOOL nodes (executor_tool, verified actions), not into a delegated agent's shell — $DEPLOY_CREDENTIAL was unset and the agent had to recover the path from the task header. The prompt now gives {{secrets.deploy_credential}} as the reliable path and says the unset env var is expected, not evidence of a missing credential.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    modernize takes ONE lot per run by design; the programme is a suite of runs, and someone has to be the suite. That someone was a human first: a full modernisation programme was replayed end to end under manual supervision and the interventions were counted — nearly all mechanical, and the acceptance criterion held on every re-record act (observed diff == announced set, every time). This bot mechanises exactly what was mechanical and routes the rest to a human.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A worker that may not re-record announces; the party that owns the net answers. Three HTML-comment blocks in REBASELINE.md carry the protocol so a supervising process can execute the separation of powers mechanically: a request names its lot, its cause and the EXACT expected paths; an act is written only when the observed diff equals that announcement; a verdict only when the full counter-test replayed green on the committed tree.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    {{input.moved}} arrives in a python script as the token 'false', and any json field can carry true/false/null inside. Found by the bot's second real run: the steward crashed on NameError. One line gives the three JSON atoms their Python names before interpolation.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Every script tool sees its own .iterion-script-*.py in the workspace for the lifetime of the node (executor_tool materialises it there), so the supervisor's clean-tree refusal fired on every run, and the steward would have counted it in every observed diff. Found by the bot's first real run: preflight refused a freshly created worktree. Excluded from all three status reads — it is execution machinery, never part of a verdict.

    The run-level override stopped at the launch boundary: a cloud pod re-resolved the guard from the workflow and its own empty environment, so `--loop-budget-guard off` on a bot that declares nothing ran guarded anyway, and `on` against a bot declaring `off` could still strand its work at the cap. An operator's explicit choice, quietly re-made elsewhere — the failure `auto_memory` closed at schema v6.

* **runtime:** decline a loop back-edge the budget cannot fund ([#402](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/402)) ([a62939a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a62939a9c54ac8457eef881e3436be77ff27a233))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A loop that banks work as it goes — commits in stride, a published report, a PR opened by a tail node — used to start an iteration it could not pay for, die mid-iteration on BUDGET_EXCEEDED, and leave the tail that would have delivered the work unreached. iterion's own docs-refresh weeklies lost 31 and 29 alignment commits that way, on a clone that died with the pod.

    Switch the feature-dev and whole-improve-loop campaign nodes from interaction: human to interaction: async (ADR-081) and rewrite mission item 5: on an ambiguous mission (or a self-picked axis), the campaign posts a teach-back via ask_user_async — the goal restated in its own words plus the load-bearing assumptions — and KEEPS WORKING under those stated assumptions; answers fold in mid-run via the message queue. The blocking ask_user stays reserved for genuine hard stops, and unanswered…

### Bug Fixes

* **runner:** a weekly cap parked four reviews with nothing coming back ([#389](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/389)) ([c710817](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c710817436f5af594e3302539c0f2ae2679c7c50))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    usageWindowRetryAt documents three evidence sources for "the provider's window is shut": the typed error, a classified runtime code, "and the flattened message is a last resort for a host that has neither — which is not hypothetical, since a runner with no dispatcher wired classifies nothing at all." The third one was never implemented. usageWindowEvidence returned false unless a type or a code survived, so on any host where neither does, the provider's own words — sitting right there in…

### Bug Fixes

* **gate:** a review in flight is indistinguishable from one that never ran ([#387](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/387)) ([da6afa1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/da6afa1e73bb1db59ff38ce48591909eb5801eca)), references [buildkit-operator#19](https://github.com/buildkit-operator/issues/19)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The merge gate only ever posted a verdict, at the END of a run that takes minutes. For that whole window the required context carries NO status, which a forge renders as "Expected — waiting for status to be reported" — byte-identical to a review that was never launched. Read next to the reviewer's comment on the previous commit, it looks exactly like "the bot commented but the gate never went green". Reported from production on buildkit-operator#19 today.

    </details>
* **modernize:** a blocked lot was re-attempted on every run, forever ([98324c9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/98324c9d010739764653d95c46fc8905ff2e842a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on a replay campaign: a lot declared itself blocked after forty-two minutes — the toolchain raise it carried changes observable behaviour, and it said so in a committed report rather than force its gate green. The NEXT run picked the same lot again, redid the same work, and hit the same wall. In a single-run workflow that is harmless, since a human reads the report and decides. In a loop it wedges, and it burns the budget doing it.

## [3.35.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.34.2...v3.35.0) (2026-08-10)

### Features

* **golden-master:** a write surface, and two archetypes that were required nowhere ([3cd5a6e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3cd5a6ed293767ba850f17f35e255058e6d26f71))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The net only ever read. A corruption applied when content is STORED — a tag lost, an attribute normalised, an identifier drawn afresh on every save — moved no reference and passed the gate green, so proving it took a script outside the net. That is where such proofs end up when the net cannot write.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the report names which mutants could no longer be applied ([a994d8c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a994d8c1f7752b266c34fcd8ff02a4b10d8f80ec))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    They were already said, in free text, in the middle of the log. A mutant goes invalid for two very different reasons — it mutates nothing, so it never proved anything; or its anchor vanished under a legitimate change, so it DID prove something and has stopped. Only the second is mechanically repairable, and telling them apart means reading a field rather than matching a phrase.

    </details>
* **modernize:** repair a mutant the lot invalidated, by delegating to the net's own bot ([2e682d2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2e682d22b1ab0addb8753111eb3b0fb6896ca14a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A modernisation lot is entitled to rename a method or restructure a template. When it does, a mutant that patched the old form stops patching anything. The harness calls it INVALID, correctly, and the surface it probed stops being covered — while NOTHING goes red, because an invalid mutant is excluded from the score and the figure looks no worse. A lot can go green while the net gets narrower, which is the one failure a green cannot report.

    </details>
* **modernize:** surface which mutants the oracle could no longer apply ([383bf9a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/383bf9a3a0c707adceaa5f9962d1799a4082902f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A lot may legitimately remove the thing a mutant hooks into — a security major withdraws the matcher idiom one named, a front-end major replaces the configuration block another edited. The patch stops applying, the harness marks the mutant invalid, and an invalid mutant neither scores nor dilutes: it simply stops proving anything, quietly, on whichever lane it covered. The gate can stay green while the counter-test that made that lane worth trusting has gone dark.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** collateral blamed the mutant without ever testing a third cause ([9ee97e8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9ee97e88d530b176afb3b97ca885016e2b0e9255))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A control entry that differs from its reference was attributed to the mutant, and the message offered exactly two explanations: an under-declared blast radius, or a capture that is not isolated. There is a third, and it is the only one in which the mutant plays no part — THE CONTROL ENTRY DOES NOT REPRODUCE ITSELF. Whichever mutant happened to sample it wears the blame.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the two copies of the harness had drifted, and the test said otherwise ([c19926e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c19926e17e39162b28690189a4fe90ca56c6556a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The harness exists twice: inlined in main.bot's oracle_run node, which is the copy that runs, and as oracle-harness.py, which is the copy a human reads. A test claimed to keep them in sync. It pinned the set of top-level function names and the report fields, on the stated grounds that verbatim comparison was impossible.

    </details>
* **runview:** reset dropped nodes' execution state on run_rewound ([#382](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/382)) ([353c0c2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/353c0c28567b4d34a66b312ee230d2932e936ec5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A rewind invalidates the dropped nodes' checkpoint outputs, but the snapshot the studio renders node colours and infos from is folded from the append-only event log — and none of the three reducers handled the run_rewound event Rewind appends. The pre-rewind node_started / node_finished records kept folding in, so rewound nodes stayed painted with their pre-rewind status, duration and error instead of resetting to never-run.

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a reference carrying a carriage return never reproduced itself ([ab9c83c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ab9c83c720a98916c00bb56d3b4c71cb6816c3a0))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The harness wrote references without a newline setting and read them back without one either. On Linux the write default translates nothing and lets carriage returns reach the disk; the read default enables universal newlines and turns them into line feeds. From the moment such a reference is recorded it differs from what the capture produces — permanently, with no code having moved.

### Features

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The asymptote says why a run stops. Nothing said why the next run does not re-earn what this one banked, though the machinery for it ships everywhere: a gate reading a real exit code, a commit landed per verified unit, a diagnostic that makes a defect class impossible to repeat, a bilan that outlives the run. docs/improvement-ratchet.md gives those parts one name and one image each, and states the divergence from the family of ideas everyone will recognise: continuous improvement is unending,…

### Bug Fixes

* **rewind:** scope the workspace restore to what the run recorded changing ([#381](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/381)) ([4e29c0a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4e29c0adb0c9205929aad6552bfefb287119f7e6)), closes [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380), references [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380) [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380) [#380](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/380)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion rewind` forced the ENTIRE workspace back to the pivot's snapshot. On the default run shape — no `worktree: auto` — that workspace is the operator's live checkout, so one rewind reverted 38 tracked files and deleted 2 that no node of the run had ever written (#380).

* **golden-master:** a canvas lane, and the browser plumbing it shares ([276ee97](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/276ee97b3c64996ed0319464ed4713a3b59094e8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A canvas is the one surface nothing else can observe: the served document carries an empty tag, and the DOM stops changing once the image is painted. An accessibility audit says so itself — a datum rendered only as colour or as canvas is not restituted. A chart that stopped drawing entirely would leave every reference in a repository identical to the byte.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** keep DSL-fail runs rewindable by preserving the checkpoint ([#376](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/376)) ([5f56229](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5f56229ad79e19b8a4bb478b478752cadf820d56)), closes [#373](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/373)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run that reaches the DSL fail node was definitively unrecoverable: the fail path wrote status failed without a checkpoint, and the status transition purged the one that existed, so neither resume, rewind, nor cancel could bring the run back to a rewindable state — even though the on-disk state was coherent and the workspace snapshots survived.

    </details>
* **runview:** let a fork replace its dead parent on the pipeline board ([#377](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/377)) ([e4c17c7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e4c17c748e7c42a2a88dc56e16c37adf5db635e3)), closes [#374](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/374)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run launched from a board card and recovered via fork disappeared from its card for good: the card kept showing the dead parent with no way to detach it, while the fork — the operator's actual recovery — ran invisibly. Since fork is the only way to recover a terminal run, recovery came at the price of board tracking.

    </details>
* **runview:** stop the skip-run and finalize log loops ([#378](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/378)) ([a8e3c11](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a8e3c110d14fba756b88e5dbc681637e0dd5b39e)), closes [#375](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/375)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Run ids whose run.json was gone stayed listed by the store and were reloaded on every UI poll, each producing a WARN line — several lines per second, indefinitely, drowning the instance log (50 MB of noise on an active instance). Same family: the finalize recovery re-warned 'cannot read worktree HEAD' every minute on deleted worktrees.

* cross-backend model fallback chain (`fallbacks:`) ([#365](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/365)) ([38d4f07](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/38d4f0761016b8087c2420be71d83c7fcc48f057)), references [#1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/1)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Discharges the cross-API deferral ADR-004 recorded in its Decision (5) and Alternative #1, and records why the obvious generalisation (flip providerFallbackEligible) is unsafe: a backend swap re-shapes seven delegate.Task fields, three pre-run analyses read a single static backend name, and both the run-level usage-window retry and the credential-pool donor cooldown key on the terminal error's type.

* **e2e-coverage:** Endy — matrix-anchored e2e coverage completion bot ([f3de156](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f3de1569feea7f8a9a49ad04eeda53f5ad5881f9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ADR-058 v2 shape (one campaign + deterministic gate + bounded continuation), specialized for FEATURE-level e2e completeness: a committed feature×coverage matrix is the inventory, the living todo, the done-oracle and the audit trail. The verify_run gate enforces the matrix contract deterministically — parse, allowed statuses, justified exceptions, and a claims check where every covered-* row must cite a test that resolves in the tree (an orphan claim is a red gate). new_test_code is…

### Bug Fixes

* **cli+e2e:** two round-2 test findings — a base64 blind spot and a 210s detection ([c0d3080](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c0d3080421d5f1e24863dec8381e16d16f1aee04))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The secret round-trip claimed 'no plaintext on disk' but grepped only the raw bytes; the sealed field is a []byte, which json writes as base64, so a Seal/Open pass-through mutation (no encryption at all) survived the assertion. It now greps the base64 forms too — measured: the mutation that survived is killed, naming the store file.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** close eight false-green bypasses in the matrix gate ([7dcf452](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7dcf452695b72860f8be92a56a879ce93080ed3c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial review executed seven distinct ways to make the gate say matrix_ok=true on a matrix that proves nothing, counts less than it claims, or is not even the table the operator reads:

* **e2e-coverage:** inventory the nine surfaces the audit found missing ([c5521d5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c5521d527bfc5bee03e29a91f0a212edbc365bc9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The matrix claimed completeness while nine operator-observable surfaces had no row at all — an omission is exactly what the inventory promise forbids. Six were already covered and only needed citing (bots install core, `bots templates`, plugin lifecycle run, /api/v1/pipeline-board, /api/v1/limits/cost, /api/backends/detect); three are real gaps now visible: `iterion server` and `iterion runner` CLI boot, and /api/effort-capabilities (reached today only as a readiness probe that asserts nothing…

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** repair eleven more mis-citations found by the second audit ([9ecb92b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9ecb92be2fd1d11e417551b30988aa1be223d260))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A second adversarial pass sampled 40 fresh rows (70 across both audits) and found the same failure mode as the first: a row cites the mechanics of a helper while the WIRING that invokes it goes untested.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** repair four façade citations found by the matrix audit ([dc7d422](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/dc7d42263fc69e89b4c7f32e344fc860cb559f5f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial audit sampled 30 covered rows and found four whose cited test would pass while the promised feature is broken:

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** round-2 gate hardening — a false POSITIVE and six more bypasses ([83e588d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/83e588d5e6fe9d10aa9d14d9a731cda4a2a75a69))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The round-1 hardening was itself reviewed adversarially. The worst finding is a false positive, which in a blocking gate costs as much as a hole: the test-file regex required a slash on BOTH sides of tests/ and spec/, so a ROOT-level tests/ (Rust, pytest), spec/ (RSpec) or __tests__/ (Jest) was rejected — this gate would have refused the legitimate matrix of most non-Go repos and could never converge there.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** round-3 — the round-2 hardening had narrowed the gate to Go ([2e8d7a7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2e8d7a784afc5d6b0dc8849b5ac45346b0146a9c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Round 2 fixed a false positive and introduced two more, in the same place: the gate had quietly narrowed to matrices whose citations look like Go test function names — which is this repo's shape and almost nobody else's.

    </details>
* **e2e-coverage:** verify.sh must be overwritten and workspace-relative ([0af0da7](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0af0da7b847e570cfcc917d0af2d694da7938c61))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The scratch dir is per-project, shared across runs: V3's verify_build found V1's script pinned to a dead worktree path. The prompt now mandates overwrite + $PWD-relative commands (the gate already runs the script with the repo root as cwd).

    </details>
* **e2e:** two live fixtures died on a cd into an unexpanded variable ([3c822d1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3c822d15eccc8d26b3118c84fea951b5a8eaaa42))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    feat_worktree.bot and feat_compress.bot both opened their tool command with cd "${PROJECT_DIR}". That placeholder is only expanded in a bot var DEFAULT, never inside a command, so the shell got cd "" and the node failed before doing anything — TestLive_Feat_Worktree and TestLive_Feat_Compress could never pass, whatever the feature did.

    </details>
* **queue:** a message from a newer server is transient, not malformed ([ca2ef58](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ca2ef588e1ffcf730951584aab5a3a96f048f3cf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A runner that could not decode a delivery Termed it, whatever the reason. For a malformed payload that is right — no consumer will ever decode it. For a payload from a NEWER server it destroys a run: the queue entry is gone while the run document stays `queued` forever, and the only trace is one line in one pod's log. Nothing surfaces to the operator, who sees a run stuck in "queued" with no explanation.

    </details>
* **runtime:** a structured LLM call now anchors a turn, like a text one ([5d162d8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5d162d871e27c6f389946cc19c08d18af123c358))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Turn capture lived only in GenerateTextDirect. Every node declaring an output: schema — which in iterion is most of them — runs through GenerateObjectDirect and so anchored NOTHING: no TurnCheckpoint, an empty per-node timeline, and `iterion fork` failing with "turn not found" on a run that had plainly executed. The Fork API and the timeline were effectively blind to the majority of claw nodes.

    </details>
* **studio:** a workflow with no LLM nodes no longer crashes the Launch view ([457374d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/457374dddc6b849acf17a36f1c5213c6f8e0aedd))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    POST /api/runs/preview-cost answers {"nodes": null} for a workflow with no agent/judge node, and CostPreviewChip dereferenced data.nodes.length — the whole Launch view fell into its error boundary, so a tool+compute-only bot could not be launched from the studio at all. Found by the new studio UI Playwright suite (V4 dogfood, run 019fd6e6); the KNOWN-BUG tripwire test now asserts the positive contract instead.

    </details>
* **test:** detect nested checkouts by their .git, not by directory name ([bbe2dd9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/bbe2dd9de0fefb2af29f19cd7b1b94df30634731))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous fix hardcoded .claude and .works — one is this harness deal, the other is a purely local convention of one operator. Where someone parks their worktrees and sibling clones is not this repo business.

    </details>
* **test:** the bot-identity audit walked into the operator nested checkouts ([8c42f09](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8c42f098cc62701bb403b716af9cf90b11d29c64))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    TestEveryExecutorConstructionDecidesTheBotIdentity walks the tree to find executor constructions that skip the bot identity, but its skip list did not cover .claude/worktrees or .works — git worktrees and sibling repos an operator keeps on disk. None of their files are tracked here, and their older copies report as offenders of a rule they predate, so the test passed inside a worktree and failed in the main checkout.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    At run start iterion mirrors the bundle's skills into the worktree under `.claude/skills/`. Finalize then read those untracked files as "the bot left work uncommitted", banked them as a wip commit — and a wip-banked HEAD is never merged, by design. The result: a run whose gate CONVERGED did not land, and the only thing standing in the way was iterion's own scaffolding.

    Auto-memory behaved differently on each backend, silently, and no .bot author could control it: claude_code's own default is ON, so every node of every run read and wrote the operator's personal ~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/, while claw and pi had no MEMORY.md at all. On a cloud pod, anything written to a pod-local directory died with the run.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** a run launched from a linked worktree described another branch ([ca72827](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ca728277cc4c2deb55007f1eb0e4262e89be2465))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion run` resolves the repo root up to the MAIN repository — that is where .git lives and where worktrees are registered, and it is correct. It then read `HEAD` there too, which is not: a linked worktree has its own HEAD and its own branch, and the run silently anchored on whatever the main checkout happened to be on.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** host_state=none dropped the git identity along with the mount ([365c048](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/365c0482ea2fd98651cb05654178496c869d299c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Under host_state: auto the operator's ~/.gitconfig is bind-mounted, and that mount is what gives an in-sandbox `git commit` an author. Turning host state off — the documented setting for multi-tenant and cloud runners — removed the mount and, with it, the identity: every commit-producing bot then dies on "Author identity unknown", for a reason unrelated to what it was asked to do.

    </details>
* **sandbox:** the shipped images declare no locale, so the JVM read ASCII ([0223a9e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0223a9e49caa959668bbfcce0d83bb71f75a56d1))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Measured on the slim image: `LANG` and `LC_ALL` are both empty. That is not a neutral state — it IS the C/POSIX locale, and a JVM derives `sun.jnu.encoding` from it and decodes filenames as ASCII. A build whose resources carry an accented name fails on "Problems opening file input stream", naming a file that is plainly on disk. An agent working in the sandbox has to discover this and prefix its own commands to get past it.

* **dep-update-guard:** the drift-gate precheck loops back instead of discarding the run ([#370](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/370)) ([722bacf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/722bacfee3cf53193154a9e7ba2a9b5c8308c56c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Twice in one day the aligner's correct Vite 8 migration was thrown away because verify.sh omitted the repo's CI drift gate and the deterministic precheck fired at VERDICT time (rc=3 → hold_unstable, alignment discarded). The omission is an authorship defect, not a red build: the agent scopes 'bump-relevant' and rationalises away repo-wide gates (a studio bump 'cannot drift' the Go openapi — but §1b gates are never scoped out).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    EstimateUSD consults claw's LIVE pricing registry first, so the price tests' expectations depended on whatever the network returned that day — flaky on the host, and reliably wrong inside sandbox pods, where this failure has now twice painted a Vetty verify red on an otherwise CI-green PR (#19's Vite 8 alignment being the second). Pin the tests to the fallback path via CLAW_DISABLE_LIVE_REGISTRY=1 except where the live-cache behaviour is itself under test (seeded explicitly).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git status --porcelain` writes `XY <path>`, and X is a space for an unstaged modification. Stripping the whole output before splitting ate that leading space on the first line only, so it shifted by one and lost a character: `build.gradle` came out as `uild.gradle`. Later lines were intact.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run completed with Status FINISHED having executed no lot at all. The plan reader could not find yq, emitted nothing_to_do, and the graph routed straight to done. Every failure path in that reader called the same emit(), which exits 0 — so three very different outcomes collapsed into one benign one:

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A bundle or a repo could declare devbox packages and get NONE of them, with the run continuing as if they were there. Three causes, each measured on a real run rather than reasoned about, and each fixed where it belongs.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Narrowing which freshly-applied issue label dispatches the implementer (`label_allowlist`) was a webhook-config PATCH, and Provision rebuilds that config as a whole literal from the manifests. Any bot-set change — the studio Integrations tab PATCHes bot_ids and nothing else — therefore dropped the narrowing, silently and fail-OPEN: an empty allowlist matches every label, so the repo returned to starting a feature-dev campaign on any label added to any issue.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    cost.Annotate received task.Model — the node-declared model, empty on every node that relies on backend auto-detection — so EstimateUSD priced against an unknown model, emitted no _cost_usd, and the whole run reported tokens but no cost (the studio report then shows its 'no cost recorded' placeholder forever; observed on the feed-watch cloud runs, where system/init resolved claude-opus-5 but the node declares no model).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Aggregator feeds (FeedBlitz, FeedBurner) serve tracking URLs whose host is the aggregator's, not the article's. The synthesize agent web_fetches those items, lands on the canonical article and naturally cites its final URL — which the deterministic verify_message gate then rejects as off-item, failing the whole digest (observed live: the java digest run 019fc65e died on two baeldung.com links served as feeds.feedblitz.com items).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    EnsureManagedSecret returned the stored managed-secret id without touching its plaintext — a ONE-HOUR GitHub App installation token minted at provision time. On a quiet connection (no provision, no worker rotation) every repo-targeted launch pinned that dead token and failed its clone with 'Invalid username or token' (observed live on prod relaunching the feed-watch java digest; the daily schedules never noticed because they resolve the team's forge_token binding instead).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A generic engine failure Naks for redelivery, and every failed delivery fired the completion webhook + run.<outcome> event anyway — one 'run failed' notification episode per redelivery (the episode key folds updated_at precisely so a later REAL re-failure notifies again), i.e. up to MaxDeliver pushes for a single deterministic failure within a minute (observed live: feed-watch run 019fc65e re-failed 8 times in 70s on its checkpointed verify input).

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A run whose model could not be priced records _tokens without _cost_usd; the Report tab treated that as 'no cost yet' and showed the fills-in-as- nodes-finish placeholder forever, even on finished runs. The report now renders whenever any usage (cost OR tokens) exists: bars and rankings scale by tokens when no cost was recorded, and cost cells show an explicit '—' rather than a fake $0. Buckets tie-break by tokens so a tokens-only report still ranks meaningfully.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In a mixed run (some nodes priced, some not) the report-level hasCost flag rendered unpriced buckets as "$0.00 / 0%" next to their real token counts, reading as "this node was free". The cost and percent cells now decide per bucket: no recorded cost renders as an explicit unavailable marker. Found by adversarial review.

    The inventory's sort was one value shared by both tabs, defaulting to priority. But priority is a launch-order key, and a pipeline that already ran will never be launched by it again: on Closed the ranking buried this morning's run under a months-old P9.

### Features

* **runtime:** a tool node can hand a file it produced to the run ([#347](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/347)) ([fd0d0b8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fd0d0b8a89e22585c7f1c7cb80ed6df9a38b89dd)), references [iterion#332](https://github.com/iterion/issues/332) [#336](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/336)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A gate previews a `file` value by fetching `GET /api/runs/{id}/attachments/{name}` — the descriptor's path is a host or sandbox bind-mount path and is not reachable from a browser (iterion#332, #336). So attachments only ever entered a run from a PERSON: the launch form, a `file`-typed gate field, the 📎 button.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A pipeline that died mid-flight used to file itself under Closed and hand its concurrency slot straight to the next queued card. Closed means "this reached its end", and a crash did not — so the failure read as done, and by the time the operator fixed it the slot was gone.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In cloud mode a rolling deploy SIGTERMs the runner pods. Previously a gracefully-drained in-flight run was checkpointed as `cancelled`, which the redelivery reconciliation deliberately drops (anti-resurrection guard) — so the run needed a MANUAL resume and every deploy emitted a false "run cancelled" web-push. Only the crash/timeout paths auto-resumed.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **drain:** close what auto-resume re-opened ([3e3c2f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3e3c2f09df65e5e438aea4495886736c07b6b1ed))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Making an interruption auto-resume turns a rare, operator-driven recovery into a routine one, so paths that were safe because nobody took them are now taken on every scale-down. Found by an adversarial pass over the rebase.

* **gate-autofix:** the unattended launch reached Mongo with no tenant ([b68f8a3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b68f8a39fd6240e5679db6eb08ac6d5b91236e20))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The auto-fix lane stamped the auth identity the admission gate reads and not the store identity every tenant-scoped query asserts on. A bus handler is not an HTTP request and carries neither; the inbound-webhook middleware stamps both and this lane copied half of it.

    </details>
* **runner:** don't resurrect an operator cancel during a lame-duck drain ([f700b5b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f700b5b7197b556008ac02752db043c3b36218dc))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adversarial review found a HIGH regression: the shutdown-vs-operator distinction inferred "shutdown cancel" from parent.Err() (the loop ctx), which only means "a SIGTERM happened" — not "this run's cancel came from shutdown". In the default lame-duck mode the pod holds the run for up to DrainTimeout (8h), during which an operator cancel (via the iterion.cancel.<run_id> subject) would be misclassified as a shutdown interruption, promoted cancelled→failed_resumable, and auto-resumed —…

* **runtime:** route mid-node interruptions through the cause-aware handler ([b14e11c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b14e11c39bce44dabfb64184307956d66b7fcc68))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adversarial review of the cause-threading refactor found the clean handling only fired for the between-node/pre-run window (the top-of-loop select). The COMMON real case — a deploy drains a run WHILE an LLM node is executing — surfaced the cancellation as the node's execErr and routed it through failRunWithCheckpoint, which stringifies the error and loses the ErrRunInterrupted sentinel: the runner then fired a spurious "run failed" notification and stamped finalStatus=failed, even though the…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A value box that never puts its content permanently out of reach: short values render whole, long ones collapse to a preview with a "Show all N lines" toggle that expands IN PLACE. Every value carries a copy button, and a JSON value (structured, or a JSON string as bot_args carry them) gets a raw/pretty toggle.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** an edge mapping wrapped in literal text lost the literal ([#337](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/337)) ([262ff04](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/262ff041927bcf0125554fe4db011b33a55beff5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `resolveMapping` never interpolated. With exactly one reference it returned that reference's value and dropped everything around it; with two or more it returned the raw template, unresolved. Only a mapping whose whole value was a single `{{…}}` came out right — which is why this survived: that is the shape almost every mapping has.

## [3.19.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.18.1...v3.19.0) (2026-08-01)

### Features

* **studio:** render a human gate's inbound payload so operators see what they are validating ([#336](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/336)) ([79d6110](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/79d611067d42d750983002a82267f0e94e2a4fae)), closes [#332](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/332), references [iterion#332](https://github.com/iterion/issues/332)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A paused gate could not show the operator WHAT they were validating. The data was already there end to end — `Engine.persistPause` resolves the node's incoming `with {}` mappings and stores them as `Interaction.Questions`, which the run console and the pipeline board both receive — but the form is driven by the node's OUTPUT schema, so the inbound half reached the browser and was dropped on the floor. Authors worked around it by stringifying the plan/diff/verdict into `instructions:`; anyone…

### Bug Fixes

* **e2e:** pin the fixture's model so it compiles without a host credential ([82371ea](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/82371ea4a7726ba26f872c7c83773ffa4147c047))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The hand-off publish test passed locally and failed on main. C018 rejects an agent node that names neither `model:` nor `backend:` UNLESS the runtime can detect a credential — so a developer machine with Claude Code OAuth compiles the fixture and CI, which has none, does not.

    </details>
* **handoff:** publishing the fallback let a crashed review shadow a complete one ([4bd82c8](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4bd82c830b7ddc6bc707b64709ed16638d14c54d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

* **handoff:** the node a manifest names as a source has to publish something ([f066c0c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f066c0ce8457b832f502244397246fbc35fa475e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The live dogfood found the hand-off resolving to nothing, and the first read of the evidence — no artifacts on any cloud run, zero `artifact_written` events — pointed at cloud storage. That was wrong, and the correction is the whole fix.

    </details>
* **launch:** a bot launched off the board could not publish anything ([5157144](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/51571448218e848abbdb6364853cb7292c71fd5d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The cloud coordinator launches a card from its BotArgs alone, so two things the webhook tail composes inline never reached it: the forge-publish grant and the repo's launch policy. A board-mode fixer therefore pushed its commits and then had nowhere to post — no verdict, no ledger, no merge-gate status — leaving the repo's required check on the pre-push revision, which blocks the PR on a check that is absent rather than red. Measured side by side with the reviewer on the same PR.

    </details>
* **launch:** the stale provisioning was winning a re-provisioned repo ([cdfedc1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cdfedc12406e5a37d2c3702a67b787d5cabc2cc2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Resolving one repo among several provisionings by lowest id is deterministic and arbitrary. On the e2e repo it picks the row from 2026-07-17, on a personal token, over the GitHub App it was deliberately re-provisioned onto — so the verdict would be posted under the operator's own account, which is the identity whose comments the loop guard refuses.

    </details>
* **webhooks:** the fixer's push was the one delivery the gate never saw ([db2676c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/db2676c5b9605185c77988696f3afed9b3ed0579))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The iterion-bot guard skips a pull request our own loop produced, keyed on the sender. On a merge-gate resync the sender is by construction our own forge bot — a fixer that just pushed onto someone else's PR — so the guard swallowed the delivery the whole gate depends on.

### Features

* **branch-improve-loop:** let the operator choose where they sit in the loop ([d81c0bf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d81c0bf7f5663c11d09f1fdb1d1f8002015f3ed9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A reviewer alone already puts the human in the middle: findings land, the human decides which to act on and how. The fixer is the more invasive option, and offering only it would take that arbitration away — you either read findings yourself, or you hand the whole thing over.

    </details>
* **branch-improve-loop:** speak for the head you pushed, and never green it for free ([6398c48](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6398c487d7587a7ca6ee87e5b102b99603ab2b6f)), references [#322](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/322)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A fixer that pushes moves the head, and the merge-gate status stays on the old one. A required check that is ABSENT is indistinguishable from one still running: the pull request waits for a context that will never arrive, with every other check green and nothing pointing at why. That is the failure #322 was written for, and pushing commits creates it on purpose.

    </details>
* **detect:** report pi, so the preference variable and the studio can see it ([a4be02b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a4be02b10dc0f8e153755e62c2fe86fd1d1e1045))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    pi was reachable only by naming it on a node. Auto-selection filters on what Detect reports, so ITERION_BACKEND_PREFERENCE=pi was inert, and the studio's backend panel and Settings → Backends could not show it at all — for the one backend whose whole proposition is "you already hold a credential for one of ~36 providers".

    </details>
* **gate:** a red merge gate can launch the fixer itself, if the repo asks ([057be3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/057be3aae1fcaeba0d2c0c2f9b6a73241cb17364))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    only those. The default stays as it was, and that is the decision rather than caution: a reviewer already leaves the developer in the middle (findings land, they choose what to act on, and a comment hands the work over whenever they want). Turning the hand-over automatic everywhere would take that arbitration from every developer on the repo to save one comment.

    </details>
* **handoff:** a reviewer and a fixer cooperate without the engine naming either ([fc3e342](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fc3e3423b396d9932ca66286d4cf92685da04756))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The run-to-run hand-off was written as a pair of hardcoded identities: a `botID != "branch-improve-loop"` guard, a producer pinned to "review-pr", and that bot's three node names (`converge`, `merge_reviews`, `diff_precheck`) as engine constants. So the engine knew which bot reviews, which bot fixes, and the internal graph shape of one of them — the coupling CLAUDE.md forbids, and the reason a second reviewer or a second fixer needed an engine PR rather than a bundle.

    </details>
* **handoff:** the fixer answers the review, finding by finding ([cbdad61](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cbdad61a1f198d779d4df28511524c6ac22e0d20))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The hand-off ran one way. A reviewer handed over N findings with stable ids, and the reply was a prose summary: the PR author was shown N problems and then told "hardened this PR", with no way to see which were answered, which were dismissed, and on what grounds. A later review, given nothing, re-raised whatever the fixer had silently decided against — the oscillating relay ADR-058 removed from the catalog, reconstituted across two bots.

* **pi:** drive the openai-codex provider from the host's Codex login ([83cb5e5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/83cb5e56ca12a3ecca396cdd3f111339cbc9bcbf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    pi reaches ~30 providers through an API-key environment variable and `openai-codex` through none of them: that provider is OAuth-only, its tokens live in pi's own auth.json, and they are minted by an interactive `/login`. So a host already holding a working Codex credential — the very file iterion reads for claw's ChatGPT-forfait path — could not hand it to pi at all, and `backend: "pi"` on a ChatGPT plan was unreachable. Verified two ways before building anything: pi's provider table lists an…

    </details>
* **pi:** keep per-run state out of the target repo's checkout ([74b71f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/74b71f0c7fbc2763c7a32fb1abb631fef631c456))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Five review rounds in a row found holes in the guards protecting <WorkDir>/.iterion/pi — a symlink at a component, at the leaf, at the .gitignore inside it; a relative root that made containment fail open; a pre-seeded .gitignore whose last effective rule re-included our files. Each fix was correct and each left an adjacent hole, because they all patch the same premise: iterion writes a credential and a session transcript into a directory the target repository controls.

    </details>
* **reviews:** the review hand-off carries the patch it already wrote ([208852f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/208852fb4be4f2fc00b15dd97928387123b07838))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Seeding the fixer with the reviewer's findings exists to save it a round. The digest was dropping the fields that do exactly that.

    </details>
* **runtime:** the engine reports which skills it owns, so a backend can trust them ([b4abbdf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b4abbdfb3e6a2dc637df7e207e12322e41e6357f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The durable fix for a boundary my last two attempts only pretended to hold. pi is launched with `--no-approve` to refuse the target repo's project-local resources, but `--skill` paths bypass that gate — so handing pi `<workDir>/.claude/skills` loaded whatever the repository itself ships there, as a trusted skill, on every node. For a webhook-launched review or triage bot against an untrusted repo that is attacker-authored prompt text.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **delegate:** the other two writers under <WorkDir>/.iterion refuse a repo symlink too ([8183b6b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8183b6b73516068df26deaa8026c59a83258cb0b))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi raised this as an open question rather than a finding: if a repo-committed `.iterion` symlink is in the threat model for the credential, it is in scope for the composed system prompt and the session guard, which MkdirAll through the same path. It is — and the primitive is arguably worse there: a repo choosing where a host file lands, with directories created along the way, out of a path iterion picked.

    </details>
* **gate:** the zero-touch lane had no working brake ([b066d3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b066d3aec8e22a990be42d89df140fd5881fe82c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A simplify pass and an adversarial pass over the new lane. The two agreed on the same root cause from opposite directions: the launch tail was hand-rolled instead of reusing `launchWebhookTarget`, and everything that copy silently dropped was load-bearing.

    </details>
* **handoff:** five ways the gate went green when it should not have ([e862915](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e86291598a166d3b109b3ffa56d6ceeb0b93eb86))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    An adversarial pass over the branch. Two of these would have merged unfixed code through a required check.

* **handoff:** the board lane is where a /command bot actually launches ([cb60ac0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cb60ac0ce5f7e327b0e3ad2ffbd64aa8899e18dc))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Moving the seed into the shared launch tail covered every lane but the one that matters most for a `/command` bot: with a cloud dispatcher active, a board-mode command materialises a card and RETURNS — the card is the launch, and the coordinator launches from BotArgs only. The tail is never reached, so the seed was dropped on exactly the path `/billy` takes in production, with no error and the bot falling back to its DSL default.

    </details>
* **pi:** --skill must not smuggle the target repo's own skills past --no-approve ([a951e6f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a951e6f63ad45edb491bc05cbc4c8db844ed4243))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A security regression I introduced with the bundle-skill fix, caught by Revi. Widening the gate from `len(task.SkillHints) > 0` to "the mirror directory is non-empty" changed WHAT gets handed over, not just how much: `<workDir>/.claude/skills` is a checkout of the TARGET repository under `worktree: auto`, so a repo committing its own `.claude/skills/x/SKILL.md` had that markdown loaded into every pi node as an explicitly-supplied skill.

    </details>
* **pi:** a bundle's skills must reach pi ([1dd232c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1dd232c0c900c1f1bd9c48887608860f37bdcd43))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The --skill flag was gated on `len(task.SkillHints) > 0`, which is the wrong signal. SkillHints carries ONLY the DSL `skills:` field — the skill LIBRARY — while every BUNDLE skill is mirrored into <workDir>/.claude/skills/ without ever touching it. So for a bundle bot the flag was never emitted: pi had zero skill awareness, and an agent whose own prompt ordered "LOAD YOUR SKILLS FIRST" was left hunting for files it had no way to see.

    </details>
* **pi:** a relative workdir disarmed the guard entirely, and the walk covered only the credential ([67fd79e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/67fd79e50c25130df3e39f90e32b296222f0d2bb))

* **pi:** gitignore is last-match-wins, so a `*` anywhere proved nothing ([1d13476](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1d1347619068098ec877abcd5e51990fe5e90fa0))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Same fail-open shape as the symlink series, one layer up in the PARSING. piWriteIgnoreGuard short-circuited on any line trimming to `*`, but git resolves ignore rules last-match-wins: a repo committing `.iterion/pi/.gitignore` with `*\n!auth.json` (or plainly `*\n!*`) made the function return "already guarded" having written nothing, leaving the seeded ChatGPT access + refresh token stageable by a campaign agent's `git add -A` and fast-forwarded onto the operator's branch.

    </details>
* **pi:** guard the directory pi actually writes into, and stop failing a legitimate store symlink ([5a39c1e](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5a39c1ec63d55afe62fe50b15f3fb87539034e17))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous commit put the symlink refusal in writeSystemPromptFile, which was wrong twice over. It could never be the boundary — that function is SKIPPED for a node with an empty system prompt, and for pi `AppendToNative` means an agent node with only a `prompt:` yields exactly that — so `.iterion/pi` as a tracked symlink still redirected the extension bundle and pi's own session transcripts, which carry the node's full conversation. And it was over-broad: it refused a symlinked `.iterion`,…

    </details>
* **pi:** guard the token wherever it lands in the worktree, not just under sandbox ([0581b17](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0581b1718f2c38384014aaf51c72dc8e939af59d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi caught an asymmetry I created in the previous commit: I added the ignore-guard verification to the SANDBOXED branch only, while the store branch writes to <StoreDir>/pi with no equivalent check — and this repo's own dogfood instructions prescribe `--store-dir "$PWD/.iterion"`, which puts the store inside the git repo. So the non-sandboxed path carried the exact `git add -A` exposure the sandboxed one had just been hardened against, and the new refusal made the inconsistency look deliberate.

    </details>
* **pi:** ITERION_PI_BIN is a host path, and a source name is not a set variable ([f36e7e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f36e7e1b33890066fadff531bc2159861998f1af))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi round 19, both real.

* **pi:** keep the ChatGPT token out of git, and stop refusing nodes we do not fund ([7903c78](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7903c781a2cf3a48a1fe0011bbb41d7661c0008c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A driver whose workspace is a COPY of the host's (kubernetes tar-streams it at pod start) never sees a host-side write made afterwards. pi is handed three files BY PATH — the iterion extension, the composed system prompt, the openai-codex credential — and resolves them inside the pod, so all three were missing there. Caught by the first live cloud run of the backend (019fb968): every attempt died on `Extension path does not exist`, and the other two would have degraded silently, which is worse.

    </details>
* **pi:** make the zero-skill warning reachable, and stop the guard eating a .gitignore ([b4c9e20](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b4c9e209f36a5682af90de398f7184ff03d976d6))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The diagnostic that says "pi got no skills" was written and then never wired: piSkillArgs took a logger, both transports passed nil, and the failure it exists to report — the agent hunting for files its own prompt told it to load — stayed as silent as before. Both argv builders now carry the backend's logger, and the warning fires on the case that matters: the engine named skills and none of them resolved.

    </details>
* **pi:** one --skill per skill, and make detection read what the run reads ([b56fbf3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b56fbf300ea55507ee36051cd1862f560a5a5f90))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Six defects from an adversarial review of the bridge. The two that mattered were both mine reasoning backwards from an untested assumption.

    Adversarial round 2, aimed at the previous round's FIXES because that is where the last five rounds found the defect. It held.

* **pi:** the ignore guard must not follow a symlink the checkout shipped ([a37a99d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a37a99d9760802b5a5418f2a75f04cda2fec3ce2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The path guards walk TO the seed root; none of them looks INSIDE it. And MkdirAll is a no-op on a `.iterion/pi` the checkout pre-populated, so a repo can ship `.iterion/pi/.gitignore` as a tracked symlink. Two things follow, and the second is the one that matters:

    </details>
* **pi:** the last two Revi findings, one of them my own argument turned on me ([4fcef55](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4fcef55128417c2c64468b6cd0d4bd2bfda80900))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    **detect's Codex probe was more optimistic than the bridge that consumes the credential.** codexChatGPTAvailable hand-rolled a parse accepting `auth_mode: "chatgpt"` alone, while piCodexSeed gates on CodexCredentialsView.IsChatGPTMode — which also requires an access token and an account id. So a partially-written or logged-out Codex state made detect report pi available, the preference variable resolved there, and the bridge then stepped aside and left the node to die with "No API key found for…

    </details>
* **pi:** the sibling ignore guard had the same symlink hole, one level up ([c83e885](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c83e885ecc8abbcb9c1b54f69963698320126b17))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Third instance of one shape, so this shares the CHECK rather than adding a third copy of it. piHideWorkspaceSessionDir used a FOLLOWING os.Stat on <WorkDir>/.iterion/.gitignore, which a repo can ship as a tracked symlink. Both outcomes were bad and the second was silent: a DANGLING link made os.WriteFile create an attacker-chosen host file, and a link to any existing path made the stat succeed, so the function returned as if the workspace were guarded — leaving pi's session transcripts and the…

    </details>
* **pi:** treat Revi's five findings on the pi follow-ups ([d269907](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d269907f6c19b8c9ed1c2bb848c0d58e5b80e2ec))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    **high — the stale-seed sweep deleted a live peer's credential.** I added the sweep to fix an adversarial-review finding (a SIGKILL strands tokens) and asserted an invariant that is false: "anything already here when a new node starts is by definition abandoned". The root is SHARED — by every node of a run under sandbox, and off it by every run in the store — while iterion permits parallel branches and the studio runs several pipelines at once. A second openai-codex node therefore swept the…

    </details>
* **pi:** write our own ignore guard instead of trusting one we did not author ([1ee62d1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1ee62d10e0a9ff3271ca8e49453bf9f5ab82e671))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi's high finding, and it is the root cause of the two patches before it: the guard verified `<workDir>/.iterion/.gitignore` no matter where the seed root actually landed. That file is best-effort, is deliberately never overwritten when the repo already tracks one, and says nothing about a root `--store-dir` put elsewhere under the worktree. So the check could pass while the credential sat somewhere it did not cover.

    </details>
* **runtime:** back the sandbox scratch with a shared, persistent host dir ([#330](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/330)) ([9c8e0e2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9c8e0e2a278db652ede08ce3482fe553c8b4b01d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A sub-bot child runs in its OWN container. ${PROJECT_SCRATCH_DIR} resolved to a container-local /tmp/iterion-scratch, so the file a child wrote there was invisible to the parent that later read the same path. The child reported success, the parent read an empty directory, and the run only failed much later — as "not enough results", far from the cause.

    </details>
* **runtime:** library skills ride the ownership channel, and the seed root refuses a symlink ([8121570](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8121570d858e30b8fccf2a15c5c8fe34f20ea4c5))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A skill hint is not provenance. One is recorded for every skill the workflow's `skills:` field references — INCLUDING one the target repo pre-empted, because the hint describes what the agent will see, not who wrote it. piSkillArgs derived `<workspace>/.claude/skills/<name>` from that name, so an untrusted checkout that shipped a same-named skill got its own file handed to pi as a trusted `--skill`: precisely the routing-around-`--no-approve` the gate exists to close.

    </details>
* **runtime:** own the FILE, not the directory a repo can pre-populate ([cbee1e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cbee1e1d4c27202cb45b874e9795e0b90e43e816))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A flat bundle source writes <stem>/SKILL.md, and MkdirAll succeeds happily on a <stem>/ the checkout already ships. Reporting that DIRECTORY as owned therefore vouched for whatever the target repo planted beside our file: a repo committing .claude/skills/whats-next/evil.md (no SKILL.md, so nothing shadows) got the whole directory back on the owned list. Naming the one file we wrote cannot carry a sibling. Library skills had the identical shape and get the same treatment; the directory-form…

    </details>
* **runtime:** plugin skills reach pi, and directory skills survive a resume ([65227b0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/65227b04ffdfc2a41c247c45148a413ec167210a))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Two regressions the engine-owned skill list introduced, both silent.

* **secrets:** state only the billing arrangement that was measured ([2fdcb80](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2fdcb8057145a556d20c050b4b8720c87ec5083e))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The shared subscription-OAuth warning asserted that "third-party apps bill against your EXTRA USAGE balance, not your plan limits" for ANY provider, interpolating only the name. That sentence describes Anthropic's arrangement, measured live during the pi work. Applied to OpenAI it states a billing model nobody here verified — and an operator reading a confident sentence acts on it.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion run project/bots/x/main.bot` resolved its store from the .bot's own directory, so a bot living inside the project it drives was keyed on that subdirectory: the run landed in ~/.iterion/projects/<project-bots-x-key>/ while resume, inspect, issue, dispatch and the studio all resolve <project>/.iterion. Launching succeeded and every follow-up reported "run not found" — the run was invisible to the board and could not be resumed.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    /dev/shm defaults to 64 MB in a container, and the renderer blocks there rather than erroring. The symptom is not a crash but a page that never finishes loading: the load event does not come, and the load ceiling fires while blaming the host's speed. Measured on a real runner — 240 seconds on the first page, instant on the same page locally.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A net that watches HTTP responses sees the markup change; it cannot say what degraded. Removing an accessible name moves an HTML reference and nothing in the report distinguishes it from a reworded label.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The net and the existing test suite both watch the same repository and both claim to protect against regression. Comparing them by assertion is worthless; `suite-vs-net.py` applies every mutant in turn and runs the target's own suite, so one set of trials produces both figures.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A net that watches HTTP responses and rendered documents does not watch the files a page loads.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The engine created every run with CreateRun and stamped ParentRunID in a follow-up SaveRun. Between the two writes the row existed, was `running`, and had no parent — and a row with no parent is indistinguishable from a top-level run, which is exactly what the orphan reconciler judges. Every subbot child goes through this path: the runtime spawns them, and only Service.Launch pre-creates its own rows.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a `file` schema field type so a human node can ask the operator for bytes, not just text: the studio renders a file picker at the gate, the answer is uploaded to the run, and the runtime promotes it to a run attachment before the workflow resumes. `iterion resume --answer key=@./path` accepts the same fields from the CLI.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    enablePullRequestAutoMerge only accepts a PR with something left to wait for; GitHub answers UNPROCESSABLE "Pull request is in clean status" otherwise. The audit takes longer than CI, so that is the ordinary case: a live run on socialgouv/buildkit-operator#5 posted its gate green and then armed nothing, leaving the PR open with every check passing.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Mutant reverts are `git checkout -- <file>`, restoring HEAD. The gate captures references from the working tree it starts with, the first file mutant snaps those files back to HEAD, and every capture after that describes something else. Uncommitted work is destroyed on the way, silently, and the verdict belongs to no tree that ever existed.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git init` creates .git before the fetch and checkout land, and Fetch treated the presence of .git as "this tree is complete". On a cold pod taking several launches at once, the losers of that race were handed a directory holding nothing but .git — and the plugin loader then reported it as "has no plugin.yaml and no skills/", a 502 that names the wrong cause and blocks every launch for the tenant.

* projected improvements from the AIDD framework (skill lint, fit/rot lens, memory supersede, dependency gating, reviewed-SHA guard, hold-labels) ([#290](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/290)) ([eb0ecbe](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/eb0ecbec1bdcf68d7a564cad36360fb3c5915fb1)), references [#13](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/13)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ScanFrontmatter (the shared SKILL.md parser used by both the skill library and runview's bundle-skill catalog) only read the value on the same line as `description:`. For the common `description: >` / `description: |` block-scalar form it therefore returned just ">" or "|" — so the router (Nexie) and discovery saw a one-character description for every skill authored that way.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **bots:** mono must not hand the merger a raw template ([74c46e2](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/74c46e2a72fc1b1f87309d3a05c01bb206149a72))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In mono only one reviewer runs, and an {{outputs.<absent node>.<field>}} reference renders as a LITERAL placeholder rather than as nothing — so the merging agent was shown what looks like a broken template instead of "that family did not run". Observed live: a mono review's own reviewer mistook it for a reviewer failure and said so in its report.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the emitted runner names a missing interpreter instead of blaming its own tests ([446f9bf](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/446f9bfb1f06cd2b77511e733fd8eefbc44bc8a7))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A missing python3 surfaced as "the canonicaliser tests FAIL" — a message that accuses the net when the environment is what is absent. Seen for real on a CI image nobody had checked carried an interpreter. The whole net is Python; saying so plainly costs one line and saves an hour of looking in the wrong place.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the replayability check no longer reports success when it cannot tell ([fd7bd99](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/fd7bd990ea0663beb6cc091ac3019efcf8f8ef8d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `git check-ignore` returns 0 for ignored, 1 for not, and 128 when there is no repository or no git. The check only looked at 0, so on any workspace that is not a checkout it discriminated NOTHING and left `runner_replayable: true` — the good outcome, reported for the one reason it could not see. Some CI runners hand the job a COPY of the tracked files rather than a checkout, which is exactly where this happens.

## [3.12.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.12.0...v3.12.1) (2026-07-28)

## [3.12.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.11.1...v3.12.0) (2026-07-28)

### Features

* **cli:** add --commit flag to version command ([#52](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/52)) ([a8af8ee](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/a8af8eef89c0c03ced48bcf09588ca70801b4051))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `iterion version --commit` prints only the bare git commit SHA on a single line (via cli.RawCommit()), so scripts can capture the SHA directly without parsing the full human-readable version string. The default `iterion version` output is unchanged. Output now goes through cmd.OutOrStdout() so the command is testable against a captured buffer.

## [3.11.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.11.0...v3.11.1) (2026-07-28)

## [3.11.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.10.4...v3.11.0) (2026-07-28)

### Features

* **studio+runtime:** pipeline-board & human-review overhaul + subbot editor UX (WIP snapshot) ([#300](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/300)) ([991ee1d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/991ee1d3aec4fb939456431322870c6a863fb40d)), references [#244](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/244)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Answering a paused `human` node from the studio (pipeline-board card or run console) could silently do nothing and lose the reviewer's notes. Verified end-to-end in a real browser (Playwright against the built SPA).

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** promote_audit commits what it promotes ([ae26833](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/ae268339e95b5c6bd1d01fc21af74f04b720e7db))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Moving files into the worktree is not publishing them. The worktree is destroyed when the run ends, so a promotion that only moves has produced nothing that outlives the run -- while reporting promoted: 8.

    </details>
* **reviewtopology:** make mono the default review topology ([03309fd](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/03309fdb365b9f6a7a15896af024b0d22599bbac))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Revi ran BOTH family reviewers on every review, unconditionally: it never declared the ADR-052 topology vars (its only review_mode-looking var is pr_review_mode, an unrelated inline/summary publish setting), so InjectIfDeclared no-op'd on it and there was no frugal path at all. With the merge gate wired, review_on_sync re-reviews on every push — so each push cost two full reviewer passes on an instance that should be running mono.

## [3.10.4](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.10.3...v3.10.4) (2026-07-28)

### Bug Fixes

* **dep-update-guard:** a redirect must not degrade the publish POST into an unexplainable 401 ([#312](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/312)) ([9d5efc6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/9d5efc6c995568e32e649aea77db2091dcdca525))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `forge_publish_url` is the FULL endpoint URL, not a base — Revi uses it verbatim. Vetty appended the path to it, so it POSTed to `…/api/v1/forge/publish-review/api/v1/forge/publish-review`. That path is not the auth-exempt route, so the global auth middleware answered 401 "authentication required" and no commit status was ever posted.

### Bug Fixes

* make paused resumes reliable and compact run details ([#301](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/301)) ([876e847](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/876e8477c2c3063ecf60a90784ed8b7b92bbc2f6))

## [3.10.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.9.1...v3.10.0) (2026-07-28)

### Features

* **webhooks:** /revi approve — maintainer override for the merge gate ([#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292)) ([737d2fe](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/737d2fe92fc719c3605991eefd00824893ab7052))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The human-arbitration escape hatch for the Revi merge gate: a trusted maintainer comments `/revi approve [reason]` on a PR to force-green the `revi/review` commit status on the current head, for a finding they dispute — without launching a re-review and without needing admin merge-queue bypass.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **dep-update-guard:** publish to the endpoint the server injected, not under it ([#309](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/309)) ([1867b14](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1867b14e2db3556d3aad859863ef78465f283242))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    `forge_publish_url` is the FULL endpoint URL, not a base — Revi uses it verbatim. Vetty appended the path to it, so it POSTed to `…/api/v1/forge/publish-review/api/v1/forge/publish-review`. That path is not the auth-exempt route, so the global auth middleware answered 401 "authentication required" and no commit status was ever posted.

## [3.9.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.9.0...v3.9.1) (2026-07-28)

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** one rule for the sealed path, asked rather than copied ([b8ab790](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b8ab7901d5ac5135676d78e20e3e52a5bd116885))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The morning's fix made the campaign and the gate DERIVE the sealed path from the same rule instead of one dictating it to the other. The very next commit added a third party -- the node promoting a spent set to published evidence -- carrying its own hand-written copy of that derivation. It resolved into a different repository's scratch entirely, promoted nothing, and reported success.

    </details>
* **runview+cli:** a paused run advertised resumable before it was, and the group guard demanded a contract three groups already had ([#307](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/307)) ([2cf72f3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/2cf72f37cdfad8464d526fe28456841c99ce9761)), closes [#5](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/5)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    When a run parks on a human gate the engine writes paused_waiting_human to the STORE, returns ErrRunPaused, and only then does the goroutine carrying it call Deregister on its way out. Between those, the public signal says "resumable" while the handle is still held — and the studio and the pipeline-board sidebar offer Resume on exactly that signal. A resume landing in the window failed with `run "..." is already registered`, which reads as a bug to an operator and is one to any automated chain…

    </details>

## [3.9.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.8.1...v3.9.0) (2026-07-28)

### Features

* **bots:** modernize (Morphy) — gate-to-gate lots against an oracle it cannot rewrite ([f7b72e9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f7b72e9c0609b09b2955316811969c766500d271))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The unit of work is the LOT, not the package. A dependency-upgrade pipeline whose failure path is revert-this-package-and-continue cannot express a runtime move that touches nine hundred files at once, so this is a separate bot rather than a widening of that one.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** a spent held-out set becomes published evidence ([8ce6b92](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8ce6b922a0cd33778fc8c9f822f3c033a5b204cf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The sealed set protected the hardening loop and then vanished with the run, which left the committed net unable to support its own headline claim. A third party could read '7/7 held-out detected' and had exactly as much reason to believe it as they have to believe any delivery's self-reported figures — which is to say none, and that is precisely the criticism this bot exists to make.

    </details>
* **model:** move the fleet to the Claude 5 family, and read the generation instead of listing it ([1978c3a](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/1978c3a773bae49575748b7165e7cd8172d9e07f))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Reasoning capability was decided by a list of known model ids. A list is silent when it is wrong: a model absent from it is classified as non-reasoning, extended thinking is never requested, and the run pays full price for a degraded answer without a single warning. claude-opus-5 matched none of the five patterns.

    </details>
* **models:** audit committed prices against the ones already being fetched ([02d84c0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/02d84c0f172efc7a381c43f9472490d5b19443ed))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    iterion downloads model pricing from the spec aggregator, caches it for 24h, and never reads it: InputCostPerM and OutputCostPerM were parsed and dropped, with no consumer anywhere in the tree. Meanwhile the cost estimator asks a different live source and falls back to a hand-maintained table. Two sources of truth for the same number, never compared.

    </details>
* **reviews+deps:** one merge gate per repo, and Vetty guards Renovate PRs end-to-end ([#306](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/306)) ([eac354f](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/eac354f80affd55a8570611743d4dd7cb9ce4c98)), references [#300](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/300)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A repo webhook could only ever launch a single bot per delivery: SelectBot() returns "" as soon as two bots are enabled, so the lane fell back to the hardcoded "review-pr". Co-enabling a dependency guard and a reviewer therefore lost the guard entirely, and — because the shared AuthorAllowlist is the union of every bot's, nil as soon as one bot is open — the guard's author filter was discarded too.

    </details>

### Bug Fixes

* **golden-master:** a spent held-out set is not a broken seal ([b14faca](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b14facac8c0c3797ef1faab944ae54e15aef96bf))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Publishing the set created a third way to have nothing to score, and the harness knew only two. A replay after promotion accused the operator of having cleared the seal, when the set had in fact been scored once and published exactly as designed.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** enforce the corpus width floor, on distinct references ([0b428ec](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0b428ec2d21523e1c57eb67e73f5099cf2a6ca40))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    min_corpus existed only in the campaign prompt. The harness never read it and the gate never checked it: a corpus of three entries passed as long as the three were seen. Same shape as the seal that was guaranteed by a sentence in a skill — an obligation stated to the agent with nothing behind it.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** fail the gate when the emitted net cannot be replayed ([5b23373](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/5b23373328fa89f78e79f603556c0a918f7dc1c8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The first net this bot emitted was not runnable from a clean checkout. The campaign gitignored harness.py — defensible-looking, since it is a copy of a bundle file — so the committed oracle was references plus a runner shelling out to a script that does not travel. Checked out fresh, verify-oracle.sh exits 2 with 'No such file'.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** resolve the base URL instead of baking it ([b3b6804](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/b3b680449f8390576d3fdbac97ca8f3824526f11))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The emitted net recorded base_url as a literal. Ports are derived from the repository path — the fix for two checkouts fighting over one port, where the bad case is not a refused start but the second copy capturing the first one's application and recording a net that describes a different tree. A literal therefore pins the net to the machine AND the path that recorded it.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the emitted runner exits red when the gate is red ([f77b3f0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/f77b3f01b134f66f53e61bd1921c6507256991cb))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    verify-oracle.sh printed the report and exited 0 no matter what the verdict was. The graph never noticed, because it reads the JSON and computes the conjunction itself — but this script is the entry point for CI and for humans, and both read exit codes. A runner that reports a red gate and exits 0 IS a blind judge, one level above the one this bot was built to catch.

    </details>
* **golden-master:** the negative control covers the whole corpus ([e773e6c](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/e773e6c581e064df91f00183c34457457cc63466))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    It sampled the first six entries, which left every later entry never once confronted with its own reference. A reference could be stale, or frozen against a world that had since moved, and nothing would say so unless a mutant happened to target it. That is a hole in the one guard whose job is to prove the comparators are not noisy.

    </details>
* **model:** resolve bare model names deterministically, by consensus ([c2d00a3](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c2d00a30411a40ec432cf1d8974ed961743c8f60))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The bare-name index was built by assigning into a map while ranging over one. Go randomises map iteration, so a model published by several providers resolved to a DIFFERENT provider's numbers on every process start. Five consecutive runs of the same command produced five different prices for glm-5.2, one of them zero.

* **golden-master:** derive the seal path so campaign and gate agree on it ([065fe48](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/065fe48f76200e3354092684f3a04219689efc92))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The previous fix scoped the seal to the run by forcing GM_SEALED_DIR at the gate. The campaign seals too — the golden-master skill has it run selfcheck — in another process, without that environment. It therefore fell back to the shared gm-holdout path and MOVED the held-out set there, after which the gate looked in the run-scoped path, found nothing, and would have bailed on a seal it had itself broken.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    1. The harness forced `sh` on mutant scripts, ignoring the shebang. On most systems /bin/sh is dash, which has no `source`: a helper file never loaded, every function it defined was 'not found', and the mutant died with a bare exit 127 giving no hint the interpreter had been swapped. Scripts now run honouring their shebang, with an `sh` fallback when not executable.

### Bug Fixes

* **review-pr:** harden emit `findings` contract (JSON array, not prose) ([#299](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/299)) ([6496bb4](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6496bb427c080da9e7e869fca656d23eee7959f0)), references [#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292)

    Found live on the merge gate's own PR #292 (run 019f98ed): revi/review posted `failure | 1 blocking finding` while the review body said "0 findings kept". Root cause: the converge/emit LLM returned `findings` as a PROSE STRING ("4 findings kept (0 critical, 1 high, 2 medium, 1 low)…") instead of the JSON array of objects the schema intends. `findings: json` accepts a string (the DSL has no object-array type), so nothing rejected it. Downstream, publish_review's `JSON.parse(FINDINGS)` fails →…

## [3.7.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.6.1...v3.7.0) (2026-07-25)

### Features

* **forge:** iterion remote forge refresh — re-sync a connection's grants now ([#298](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/298)) ([75c02e9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/75c02e91e3a0f48d62bd3da582ca2987b61435a8))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Operability tool motivated by the merge-gate rollout: after changing a GitHub App's permissions (e.g. granting Commit statuses: write), an operator had to wait for the periodic refresh worker or restart the whole server for iterion to pick up the new grant. This adds a targeted, explicit refresh.

## [3.6.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.6.0...v3.6.1) (2026-07-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **forge:** request statuses:write in the runtime App token (unblocks merge gate) ([#295](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/295)) ([0a3f9ed](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/0a3f9ed2afb5af3b8cbc5773de915f799655713c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Live prod e2e of the merge gate proved the full chain works end-to-end (Revi reviews → bot sends the deterministic gate verdict → server resolves the head SHA → SetCommitStatus), but the status did not land: the GitHub App lacks "Commit statuses: write", so SetCommitStatus returns 403 "insufficient scope". The code handles it exactly as designed — non-fatal, reported in gate_error, logged (`forge gate: … not posted: … insufficient scope`) — so the gate advises instead of blocking until the…

### Bug Fixes

* **review-pr:** second publish_review shell bug — bare double-quote truncates ([#294](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/294)) ([c06e0e1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c06e0e1c57439a57e2af7f593fa1b60300ae37d7)), references [#293](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/293) [#293](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/293) [#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The e2e re-run (after #293) still failed: publish_review produced EMPTY output (exit 0, no forge review, no revi/review status), then publish_health crashed on the empty inputs. Root cause: a python COMMENT in the publish_review body contained bare double-quotes ("high"/"blocker"/"major"). The body is wrapped by the shell in `python3 -c "…"`, so a bare double-quote ends the string and silently truncates the script. Same trap as backticks; distinct from the #293 questions-array bug (both were…

## [3.5.1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v3.5.0...v3.5.1) (2026-07-25)

* **review-pr:** publish_review shell exit-127 on multi-question reviews ([#293](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/293)) ([34df1c1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/34df1c1230124341f1a054682cf3ec160c10d653)), references [#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292) [#292](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/292)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The v0.5.0 questions channel passed a JSON array of strings through the publish_review tool node as QUESTIONS={{input.questions}}. A `json`-typed field holding an all-string array decodes to []string, which the tool-command substitution SPACE-JOINS instead of JSON-encoding (known engine bug, executor_tool.go:1047) — so the 2nd+ question landed in shell command position and bash exit-127'd, crashing the entire review (no forge review, no revi/review gate status). findings escaped this because…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The /doki comment command switches from board/any to direct/pr, mirroring /revi: a developer commenting /doki on a PR launches docs-refresh directly on the PR head (no tracking card), self-switching to incremental amend via the generic pr_url/base_ref/source_branch the webhook stamps. The manifest half of activating the amend-on-PR trigger — the /command→bot route derives from this invocation, no engine code. v3.5.4.

    <details><summary>why</summary>

### Bug Fixes

* **docs-refresh:** scope_check bases on run-start HEAD, not oldest reflog ([40ae433](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/40ae43322b6e1d9fa47529c640937895bc2e00f9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    In amend-on-PR mode the cloud runner clones the base branch (HEAD=main) then checks out the PR head, so the OLDEST reflog entry is main. scope_check diffed against it and folded the PR author's OWN code into the changed set, raising a phantom writeable-set violation that pinned scope_ok=false — so `converged` never fired and every amend run burned all its passes (live run 019f9429). Base the diff instead on the run-start HEAD: the newest reflog entry that is not one of this run's own `Bot:…

* **studio:** "Open child bot" 404 → resolve child path against the right parent ([#285](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/285)) ([c7f6aab](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/c7f6aab39c3f7fa88636921b76825a6e783a6f52))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Clicking "Open child bot" from the editor inspector could 404 (and, in a follow-up, silently open nothing): the child .bot path is resolved from the parent file with `resolveSubbotSource(parentFilePath, source)`, but `parentFilePath` (document store `currentFilePath`) can be null during the short route-hydration window — arriving from Pipelines activates the editor tab one render before EditorTabHost copies the file into the document store. With a null parent, a parent-relative `source` was…

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    git log --grep 'Bot: docs-refresh' matched any commit MENTIONING the trailer in prose — including this bot's own v3.5 feature commit (caught on the first live check against origin/main, where it picked 1a5eddf29 over the real last alignment #288). Anchor to a line start (-E --grep '^Bot: docs-refresh') so only actual trailer lines count. Test now commits a prose-mention after the alignment commit and asserts the base stays the real alignment commit.

    A cloud/sandboxed run reaches the internet through iterion's egress proxy, injected as HTTPS_PROXY and advertised at the runner's own (necessarily private) pod IP — the trusted egress boundary and the secret-redaction point (started even in `network: open` whenever a SecretRewriter is present). urllib then dials the PROXY, not the feed host, so Vigie's socket-level getaddrinfo guard rejected our own proxy as "SSRF-unsafe address <pod-ip>" and every feed failed (run 019f8feb: all 69 fetches…

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/compare/v2.0.1...v3.0.0) (2026-07-23)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **docs-refresh:** plan-then-execute comprehensive, asymptote on honest declaration (3.1.0)

### Features

* **docs-refresh:** plan-then-execute comprehensive, asymptote on honest declaration (3.1.0) ([3b8dd24](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/3b8dd2486f1c820cacbddfdaf9942a8579cc60d3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    3.0 was fast/cheap but under-delivered — it handled the ~10 advisory hints, surveyed shallowly, and honestly-but-myopically declared docs_aligned after one ~15-min pass, producing tiny PRs on a 250-doc corpus with weeks of unread semantic drift. The fix is framing, not a coverage gate: an audited.json exhaustiveness checklist was drafted and REJECTED as exactly the excess determinism 3.0 removed (it makes the agent do bookkeeping instead of the job).

    </details>
* **docs-refresh:** self-orchestrated coverage — campaign fans out its own subagents (3.2.0) ([cd6c92b](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/cd6c92bd0a816e596ecbd59d23e565a16e5d44b9))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    A live 3-way benchmark (this repo, 2026-07-23) settled why 3.0/3.1 shipped tiny PRs: a SINGLE campaign agent — exactly like a free native agent handed the same one-liner — self-scopes to the headline docs and misses the long tail. By rising coverage: Doki (~3 commits/pass, docs/ only) < native one-liner (6 fixes, missed cloud + bot READMEs) < native with a demanding prompt (reached the WHOLE corpus). The only run that got there DECOMPOSED into per-cluster sub-auditors ON ITS OWN.

    </details>
* **server,studio:** full cloud bot editing — team-authored bot store ([8850fd6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/8850fd630020be5f84bceb6da074d09d90e95711))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a writable, team-scoped bot store so the studio editor works in cloud, not only on a local filesystem. The cloud catalog stays baked read-only; tenant bots are editable and forkable.

    </details>
* **studio:** multi-file bundle editor for cloud bots ([4444448](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/4444448a3e6b91eedbbfce1a9091ed09881831b3))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Adds a "Bundle files" drawer (Toolbar, shown only for a botsource:// tenant bot) listing the bundle's files. main.bot opens in the DSL Canvas; skills/*.md, manifest.yaml and any other file edit inline in a Monaco buffer and save per-file to the bot-source store. New files can be added and non-main files removed. Reuses the FileEditDialog Monaco pattern + inferMonacoLanguage; the tab-kind system is untouched.

    </details>
* **webhooks:** PR-open auto-reviews only (Revi); Billy on /billy with Revi's review ([#283](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/283)) ([463646d](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/463646dc66235863df2a4611f76cc7d1ec35d53c))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Decouple the mutating branch-improve loop (Billy) from PR-open auto-launch: a PR/MR open now ONLY ever auto-reviews (Revi / review-pr). Removes the selectForgePRBot ticket-PR→Billy routing; the merge-queue auto-heal path (NeedsAutoHeal) is unchanged.

### Bug Fixes

* **docs-refresh:** budgets sized for self-orchestration (3.2.1) ([7213fc6](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/7213fc6c2dc0afad2cc7a9694c3cd283b71d3058))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    First 3.2.0 live run (019f8e08) aligned 40 docs across the whole corpus in pass 1 (~70 min / ~$16) — the win — but the old 2h/$60 caps guillotined it mid-pass-2 as a hard failed_resumable BEFORE finalize, and all 40 in-pod commits were lost (the exporter only runs on a clean finalize; engine gap tracked separately). Comprehensive self-orchestrated passes are long: max_duration 2h→6h, max_cost_usd 60→120, max_passes 8→4 so the asymptote reaches GRACEFUL exhaustion (which finalizes + exports +…

* **native:** unique-title prefix must respect the caller's rune budget ([89787a9](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/89787a938024ac6adf37bc22b9b4eb1112948435)), references [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N) [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N) [#N](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/issues/N)

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The atomic CreateUniqueTitle prepended "#N - " to the desired title without re-truncating, so a pipeline-board title already compacted to 80 runes became 85 once made unique — deterministically failing TestPipelineBoardTaskCreateEnsuresUniqueTitle (the server's list-then-check fallback already re-compacted; the atomic path didn't). CreateUniqueTitle now takes an optional `normalize func(string) string` applied to every candidate inside the lock; the pipeline board passes compactPipelineTitle so…

* **runner:** budget-exceeded acks (no auto-resume) — stop the git-meta clobber ([266e6ad](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/266e6ad98739b23265a33a2e2fad1cd3306abd81))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    ErrBudgetExceeded fell through to the generic Nak, so a budget-exceeded run (a resumable checkpoint) was auto-redelivered and resumed. That was doubly destructive: the same message carries the same already-spent budget, so a duration cap re-fails instantly in a pod-provisioning loop; and each redelivery re-provisions a FRESH pod whose recordRunGitMeta overwrites the first attempt's good git metadata with base==head — silently destroying the run's exported commits. Live: run 019f8e08 (Doki 3.2)…

    </details>
* **server:** tenant bot gallery slug — botregistry Path is the bundle dir ([6e679a1](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/6e679a164629f64eac6ecc2c5188307823dc12f2))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    tenantBotEntries re-keys a discovered tenant bundle to its store slug, since a forked bot's manifest name (e.g. "docs-refresh") differs from its slug and would otherwise collide with the catalog bot of that name and never surface under its own id. slugFromMaterializedPath wrongly required ≥2 path segments, but botregistry sets Entry.Path to the bundle DIRECTORY ("<root>/<slug>"), a single segment — so the slug was never applied and the tenant bot vanished from the gallery / 404'd on GET.

    </details>
* **studio:** reach editor home with tabs open + in-editor "Duplicate & edit" ([d877725](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/d8777255bc80db5eefa61e64c2735e359f0243a5))

    Two cloud editor UX gaps:

* **studio:** read-only editor for catalog bots in cloud (no more 500 on Save) ([05102a0](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/05102a0c7fcc15bd19921441e07b1bd89a48c51d))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    Opening a baked catalog bot in the cloud editor bound a filesystem path (/opt/iterion/bots/<bot>/main.bot); Save then hit /api/files/save and 500'd with "permission denied" (the image is read-only, and cloud has no writable workspace). Only a team-authored bot (botsource:// path) is writable in cloud.

    </details>
* **studio:** replace window.confirm/prompt with accessible dialogs ([5511004](https://github.com/SocialGouv/iterion/commit/551100473e5616234a96770091d236da81c45c41))

    <details><summary>why</summary>

    The a11y source-discipline test bans window.confirm/alert (design-system Don'ts); the bundle-files delete used window.confirm and the new-file / fork-slug flows used window.prompt — reddening main's Tests check on the previous commit. Delete now goes through useConfirm(); the text prompts through a new promise-based usePromptText() hook (styled Dialog + Input, validation, Enter-to-submit), mirroring useConfirm's shape.
