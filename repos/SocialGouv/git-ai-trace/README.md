# git-ai-trace

A Claude Code skill that embeds an honest, observation-only recap of human/AI collaboration inside each commit message — so the story of how the code was made travels with the code.

## Why

Codebases written with AI assistants raise a question that binary disclosure ("was AI used?") can't answer: **who actually drove what?** A developer who reframed the AI's first proposal three times exercised strong creative control, even if most keystrokes came from the model. A generated file that passed through without comment is a delegation, regardless of intent.

Percentages lie about this ("70% AI-written" is meaningless). Labels flatten it ("ACE" vs "HCE" forces every session into five bins). File-based logs lose it (a separate `AI_CONTRIB.md` breaks on rebase, generates merge conflicts, and drifts from the commits it tries to describe).

`git-ai-trace` takes a different path: a short block of **observed moments** — proposals, choices, rejections, generations — embedded directly in the commit message. Each moment is one line, pointable to a specific message in the chat. Absences are never recorded, only presences. The recap is incomplete by design, but it is honest.

## What a recap looks like

```
fix: prevent duplicate job processing under load

Workers were occasionally picking up the same job. Row-level
locking closes the race without adding infrastructure.

--- session-recap ---
What changed: Worker loop now claims jobs via SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED; batch size reduced from 100 to 20.
Moments:
- human: brought symptom (duplicate processing in prod logs) and initial hypothesis (lock contention)
- claude: diagnosed non-atomic SELECT+UPDATE across workers as root cause
- claude: proposed three remediation options (advisory lock, SKIP LOCKED, Redis queue) with trade-offs
- human: rejected Redis-queue option as over-engineering
- human: chose SKIP LOCKED option
- human: set batch size to 20
- claude: wrote the SQL patch
--- end-recap ---

Assisted-by: Claude Sonnet 4.6
```

A reader six months from now can reconstruct the shape of the session: what was suggested, what was rejected, why one option beat another. None of this is in the diff. None of it survives in a percentage. All of it survives in the commit.

## Design principles

The skill has three non-negotiable rules:

**Presences only.** The recap records what happened — proposals, rejections, generations, choices. It never records what didn't happen. No "human did not object", no "silently accepted", no "reviewed without feedback". Absences are invisible to an LLM reading the chat; recording them would be inference dressed as observation.

**Observable, not inferred.** Every moment must be pointable to a specific message in the chat. Evaluative framings ("cleverly proposed", "after productive discussion") are out. Motive claims ("chose option 2 because it was simpler") are out unless the reason was stated.

**In the commit, not in a file.** The recap lives in the commit message body, between `--- session-recap ---` and `--- end-recap ---` delimiters. It travels with the commit through rebases, squashes, and cherry-picks. A separate file would break on all three and generate merge conflicts on parallel branches.

## Where it comes from

In the spirit of transparency this tool preaches: `git-ai-trace` is not the derivation of prior art. It is the product of [a specific brainstorming chat](https://claude.ai/share/94425cfb-f4d5-4326-97c7-aac419d4f2c3) with Claude Opus 4.7, where a vague dissatisfaction with existing AI-attribution schemes got talked into the "presences-only moments in the commit message" form you see here. Proof that observation-only attribution matters: the tool that preaches it is itself a traceable artifact of an observable chat.

Two projects partially shaped the thinking during that session — not ancestors, but neighbors pushed against until a different shape emerged:

- **[TCP/UP](https://tcp-up.org/)** — a declarative protocol for editorial transparency with five labels (HUC, HCA, HCE, ACE, AIC). `git-ai-trace` shares its good-faith philosophy and commitment to justifiable sincerity, but takes a different path: moments over labels, code-scale granularity over document-scale, in-commit over alongside-the-document.
- **[AI_ATTRIBUTION.md](https://github.com/ismet55555/ai-attribution)** (Ismet Handzic) — a chronological log of creative control with six involvement levels. `git-ai-trace` shares the chronological-moments intuition, but takes a different path: no levels (still a categorization), no separate file (broken by rebases/squashes/cherry-picks).

### Further reading (adjacent, not ancestors)

Broader context on how open source is working out its relationship with generative AI:

- [**open-source-ai-contribution-policies**](https://github.com/melissawm/open-source-ai-contribution-policies) (Melissa Weber Mendonça) — a collected survey of how different OSS projects handle AI-assisted contributions in their policies.
- [**The generative-AI policy landscape in open source**](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2026/02/26/generative-ai-policy-landscape-in-open-source/) (Kate Holterhoff, RedMonk) — a landscape analysis of the policy choices OSS communities are making and the tensions between them.

`git-ai-trace` sits in the *"how do we record what happened"* corner of that policy space — orthogonal to *"do we accept AI contributions at all"* (which is the question most of those policies actually answer). See `docs/design-rationale.md` for the longer story of how the brainstorming session landed on this corner.

## Components

The repo ships three things:

```
git-ai-trace/
├── SKILL.md                          # the skill itself (Claude Code / Claude.ai)
├── hooks/
│   ├── claude-code/
│   │   └── pre-commit-recap.sh       # Claude Code PreToolUse hook
│   ├── git/
│   │   ├── prepare-commit-msg        # native git hook, editor flow
│   │   └── commit-msg                # native git hook, final validation
│   └── README.md                     # installation instructions
└── scripts/
    └── recap-log.sh                  # regenerate a panoramic view from git log
```

The **skill** (`SKILL.md`) is what Claude reads. It can be installed as a Claude Code skill (auto-invoked on "let's commit" and similar phrases) or a slash command (`/git-ai-trace`).

The **hooks** are optional. They enforce the discipline automatically, across all three paths to `git commit` (Claude `-m`, developer `-m`, developer editor flow). Without hooks, the skill still works — it just relies on Claude or the developer remembering to invoke it.

The **extractor** (`recap-log.sh`) regenerates a chronological `AI_CONTRIB.md`-style view from the recap blocks in `git log` on demand. It's a derived view — never committed, regenerated whenever someone wants the panoramic perspective.

## Installation

### The skill — one-liner

```bash
npx skills add SocialGouv/git-ai-trace
```

Installs per-project by default (`.claude/skills/git-ai-trace/`). Add `-g` for user-global (`~/.claude/skills/git-ai-trace/`). The [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) CLI handles clone, copy, and agent wiring.

Claude auto-invokes the skill when the conversation matches its description ("let's commit", "recap this session", etc.). You can also invoke it explicitly with `/git-ai-trace`.

### The hooks (optional, but recommended)

The skill alone relies on Claude or the developer remembering to produce a recap. The three hooks enforce the discipline automatically, across every entry point to `git commit`. They are **not** installed by `npx skills add` — pick up from here manually:

- **Claude Code hook** — add a `PreToolUse` entry in `.claude/settings.json` pointing at `.claude/skills/git-ai-trace/hooks/claude-code/pre-commit-recap.sh` with a `git commit` matcher.
- **Native git hooks** — copy `.claude/skills/git-ai-trace/hooks/git/prepare-commit-msg` and `commit-msg` into `.git/hooks/`, or point `core.hooksPath` at the shared directory for team-wide installation.

See [`hooks/README.md`](hooks/README.md) for the full contract, the `.claude/settings.json` snippet, and troubleshooting.

All hooks share the same validation contract:

- The commit message contains a recap block delimited by `--- session-recap ---` / `--- end-recap ---`.
- `What changed:` is present and non-empty.
- `Moments:` is followed by at least one `- <actor>: <action>` line (actor ∈ {human, claude, both}).
- `ADR:` is optional, only present if an architectural decision was formalized.

Escape hatches (the hooks let commits through without a recap when):

- The commit subject contains `[no-recap]`.
- The commit is a merge, revert, or `--amend --no-edit`.
- All staged files match trivial patterns (`.gitignore`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.claude/**`, `LICENSE`).

### Manual install (without `npx skills`)

If you'd rather not depend on the `skills` CLI, or you want to pin a specific version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SocialGouv/git-ai-trace
mkdir -p .claude/skills/git-ai-trace
cp -r git-ai-trace/SKILL.md git-ai-trace/hooks git-ai-trace/scripts .claude/skills/git-ai-trace/
chmod +x .claude/skills/git-ai-trace/hooks/claude-code/pre-commit-recap.sh \
         .claude/skills/git-ai-trace/hooks/git/* \
         .claude/skills/git-ai-trace/scripts/recap-log.sh
```

Or, once releases are published, grab the `.skill` bundle from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/SocialGouv/git-ai-trace/releases) page and unzip into `.claude/skills/` (the bundle extracts as `git-ai-trace/`).

### As a slash command only (lightest test drive)

If you want to try the skill on one session before committing to the full install:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocialGouv/git-ai-trace/main/SKILL.md \
  -o .claude/commands/git-ai-trace.md
```

Then `/git-ai-trace` in Claude Code. No auto-invocation, no hooks, no enforcement — just the skill content expanded on demand.

## Generating a panoramic view

```bash
./scripts/recap-log.sh > AI_CONTRIB.md
./scripts/recap-log.sh v1.0..HEAD > release-notes.md
./scripts/recap-log.sh --author=alice --since=2026-01-01
```

The output is a derived view; never commit it. Regenerate whenever a reader wants the chronological overview.

## What the skill is not

- **Not a gatekeeper on AI involvement.** A recap with moments only from one side is perfectly valid. The hooks enforce *presence* of a recap, not its content.
- **Not a score.** No percentage, no label, no ranking.
- **Not a proof.** It's a good-faith trace. Credibility comes from each moment being pointable-to in the chat — a reviewer can verify.
- **Not a complete record.** Silent reading, offline thinking, teammate discussions — none of that is captured. The recap claims only to record what the chat recorded.
- **Not for every commit.** Trivial commits (typo, version bump) can opt out with `[no-recap]`.

## Status

Experimental. Tested in real use on a few projects; works well enough to adopt, not yet battle-tested across many teams and workflows. Feedback welcome, especially on cases where the recap degrades (Claude smooths over moments, merges unrelated actions into one line, invents plausible-but-unverifiable phrasing).

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to report issues with concrete examples.

The design conversation that produced this skill happened with Claude Opus 4.7 over several iterations. The full recap of that design session lives in the first commits of this repo — a kind of self-application of the tool.
